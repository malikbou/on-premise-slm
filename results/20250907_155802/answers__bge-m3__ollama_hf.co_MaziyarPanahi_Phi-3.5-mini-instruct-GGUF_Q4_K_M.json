    "response": "The Student Handbook provides information on academic requirements, regulations, policies, and University life aspects such as support services. While specific details about handling personal concerns are not directly mentioned for health issues in the provided context, there is a reference to registering with a doctor under \"15.2 Other sources of support,\" suggesting that it may offer guidance or resources related to health matters. However, direct assistance on health-related problems would likely be found through dedicated student wellbeing services as indicated by completing an online UCL Student of Concern Form for further action if needed.",

      "Departmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via UCL Students webpages or in the Academic Manual, which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.",

The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.",
      "Support for financial issues | UCL Students\n\n15.1.10 Student of Concern\n\nThere are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.\n\nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.\n\nSupport for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students\n\n15.2 Other sources of support\n\nInformation about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services.\n\n15.2.1 Registering with a doctor"
