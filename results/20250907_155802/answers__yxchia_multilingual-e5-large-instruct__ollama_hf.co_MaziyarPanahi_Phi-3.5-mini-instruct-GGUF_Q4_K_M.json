      "In addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty.
