Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.\n\nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.\n\nSupport for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students\n\n15.2 Other sources of support\n\nInformation about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services.\n\n15.2.1 Registering with a doctor"
