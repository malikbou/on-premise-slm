What UCL do in computer science with diversity and collaboration?,"['One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.']","UCL's computer science department emphasizes diversity and collaboration by adopting a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist.

When was the Department of Computer Science established at UCL?,"[""An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.""]",The Department of Computer Science at UCL was established in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
