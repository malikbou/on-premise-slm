### 1.2 Head of Department's welcome

Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science.

Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.

It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.

One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.

So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.

I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.

Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department

### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome

A warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.

We are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.

In addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.

You have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.

A key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.

You can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.

#### Section 2 Introduction to the Department and Faculty

## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty

An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.

### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history

Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.

In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.

Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.

### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department

The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.

UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.

Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.

Though diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.

##### Section 5 Hours of study

## 5. Hours of study

Information on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)

### 5.1 Teaching and learning

Information on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)

Students on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.

Synchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.) If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.

#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons

There is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)

- Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

### 5.2 Personal study

Information on personal study time (Local.)

Activities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.

### 5.3 Attendance and engagement

Information on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)

#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements

UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.

The Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25

Each Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the UCL Student Attendance Policy. Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)

Students should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.

Students encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible at:

- Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

#### Section 7 UCL's Student Support Framework

## 7. UCL's Student Support Framework

Details of how UCL and the department will support students through their studies.

### 7.1 About the UCL Student Support Framework

UCL is committed to providing the support students need in order to make the most out of their studies. The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them.

- UCL's Student Support Framework

The Framework includes the following components:

#### 7.1.1 Part 1: How to Use this Framework

Helps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes:

- Where to find help and advice
- Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student)
- Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data
- Information on providing supporting evidence
- Links to other support options that are available to students.

#### 7.1.2 Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works:

| Support process | Use this if | What this covers |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Delayed Assessment Scheme | You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC's. | Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. |
| Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence. | 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. |
| Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions | You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition. | UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a 'SoRA' (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL's Student Support and Wellbeing team. |
| Academic Adjustments | You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following: | Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need |

| Exam Adjustments | You need additional support to sit an online or face-to- face exam. | Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take-Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. |
| Interruption of Study | You are thinking of taking time out from your studies . | Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. |
| Support to Study | You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL's other support processes are not providing the right level of help. | Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer-term difficulties and UCL's normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support. We will work with you to put together a Support Plan to help you get the most out of your studies. |

The Student Support Framework is just one of the ways in which UCL helps students to get the most out of their time with us:

Students who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.

##### Guidance and application (2)

Students should review the UCL Research-based education website to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.

#### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects

Information about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.

Students will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the UCL Industry Exchange Network. Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.

### 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification

Many UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legallyrecognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.

### 8.5 Module details

Programmes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)).

#### Section 9 Tutorials and supervision

## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring

### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring

UCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.

#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring

Support via Personal Tutoring

As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.

At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.

Students should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.

Tutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.

- Personal tutors | UCL Students

### 9.2 Transition mentoring

Information on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.

The UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.

First-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.

- Transition Mentors | UCL Students

### 9.3 Programming tutoring

Information on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.

All Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme .

The scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.

#### Section 10 Module information & selection

## 10. Module information & selection

Advice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.

### 10.1 Modules

Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)

Compulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.

Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.

### 10.2 Module availability

#### Modules for Computer Science students

The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.

#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)

Ancillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.

#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)

Affiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.

### 10.3 Module selection

#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25

Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment.

Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024 , however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.

- Pre-enrolment for new students | UCL Students
- Re-enrolment for continuing students | UCL Students
- Module selection | UCL Students

##### Approval of selections

Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.

##### Change of selections

Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.

Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.

##### Verification of selections

Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)

#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)

Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.

- Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students

#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places

Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.

Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:

- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)
- Students for whom the module is optional.
- Students for whom the module is elective.

Within those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.

All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.

#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module

Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.

Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.

### 10.4 Module information

Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.

A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.

#### Module catalogue

Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.

The UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.

- UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue))
- Module introductions | UCL Computer Science

#### Module deliveries

A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)) entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.

Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.

#### Module timetable

Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.

Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.

Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.

- UCL Common Timetable

### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection

Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.

#### Academic advice on module selection

For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.

Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.

#### Academic advice on specific modules

For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)).

#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting

If a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator:

#### Section 11 Changes to programme registration status

## 11. Changes to registration status

Information on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.

### 11.1 Changing registration status

Students wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual)) before making any requests to change their academic record.

Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.

- Change your programme or modules | UCL Students
- Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook

### 11.2 Changing programme

Students wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.

Students must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook.

#### Study Abroad and Placement Years

Students who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook.

- Change your programme or modules | UCL Students
- Section 4: Programme Transfers | CS Student Handbook

### 11.3 Interruption of studies

Students needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.

Students who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.

Note: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.

- Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet
- Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students
- Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook

### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme

Students wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.

Students who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.

Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.

- Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students
- Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status

If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.

If a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator:

### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status

If a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact cs.undergraduate-students@[ucl.ac.uk](https://ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact cs.pgt-students@[ucl.ac.uk](https://ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.

#### Section 12 Progression, Award, and Classification

## 12. Progression, award, and classification

Information on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.

### 12.1 Progression and award requirements

Information on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.

A programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.

| Degree | Progression and Award Regulations |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements (see Chapter 4, Section 6.5: Progression & Award |
| Masters Degrees | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the Masters Progression and Award Requirements (see Chapter 4, Section 6.10: Progression & Award |

The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure. Specific regulations for programmes are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool.

Students will be notified when the regulations for their programme are available. To find the Tool, click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.

#### MEng Computer Science progression threshold

In order to progress on MEng Computer Science, a student must have achieved the following, in addition to all other progression criteria:

1. At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.
2. At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.

These thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.

- Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook

- Portico | UCL

### 12.2 Classification requirements

Information on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.

If a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual)) (see Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual).

If a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.

The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their programme regulations are available. To find the Tool, students should click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.

| Degree | Classification Regulations |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the UCL Honours Degree Classification Scheme B (see Section 7.3: Honours Degree Classification Scheme B |

#### Section 13 Assessment and feedback

## 13. Assessment and feedback

Information on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.

### 13.1 Assessment

#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment

All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students' knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.

A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.

Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.

A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.

#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure

Each module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.

An example assessment pattern for a module:

| # | Method (or type) | Title | Weight (%) |
| ----- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 | Coursework | Coursework 1 | 15 |
| 2 | Coursework | Coursework 2 | 25 |
| 3 | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60 |

Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.

Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period

- Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))
- UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue))

#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines

Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.

Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.

##### Deliverables

An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.

Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)

##### Individual and group work

An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)

Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.

The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.

##### Engagement in group assessment activity

All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.

Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.

##### Learning outcomes

Each programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.

A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL [Module Catalogue](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue)).

##### Marking criteria

Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.

Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.

Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.

- Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

- Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

#### 13.1.4 Marking scales

Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.

Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.

Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.

- Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

### 13.2 Feedback

#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks

Regular feedback is an essential part of every student's learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.

##### UCL feedback policy

It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker's answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.

If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.

##### Computer Science feedback policy

For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.

For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days , provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.

The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.

##### Computer Science exam script policy

UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.

##### Computer Science provisional marks policy

UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

### 13.3 Examinations

Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.

An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

Please check the Students' webpages for the most up-to-date information:

- Students' webpages

#### Examination scheduling

Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.

The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:

- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025
- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025

The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.

- Chapter 4, Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

#### Examination conduct

Students must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates. Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.

#### Computer Science past exam paper policy

UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.

The department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.

### 13.4 Coursework

Information on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.

Coursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.

Most modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.

#### Coursework scheduling

Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:

- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)
- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)

Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.

#### Coursework submission

Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.

Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.

#### Support for coursework submission

Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.

Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.

### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations

Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.

Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)

However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.

The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study . Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.

#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure

If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.

- Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))
- UCL's Student Support Framework

#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission

Work is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.

For assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:

| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline) | Description of penalty to apply | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Less than 2 working days late. | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |
| 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late. | Component mark capped at the module pass mark. | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |
| Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) | Component mark of 1.00%. | Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided. |
| Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners. | Component mark of zero. | Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided. |

Work submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.

#### Application of late penalties

Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.

### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits

Information about word count limits and penalties.

Assessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.

For project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.

#### Application of word count penalties

Word count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.

- Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

### 13.7 Absence from assessments

Information about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.

Examinations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.

If a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.

#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure

If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.

### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)

Information on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.

Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:

1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);
2. be required to resit failed components of the module;
3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or
4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.

#### Condonement

Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.

Students who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.

A student's eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.

- Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

- Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students
- Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook

#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)

Where a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.

Depending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:

- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.
- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.
- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January . Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.

Arrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.

The marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)

- Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual))

#### Deferred assessment

If an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.

If a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.

### 13.9 Academic integrity

Information about UCL's examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.

#### Academic standards and integrity

High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL's world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL's referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References,

Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.

In particular, students should familiarise themselves with:

- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage.
- the UCL Moodle course 'Introduction to Academic Integrity'.
- referencing and citation requirements, as set out in UCL Library Services' guidance on References, citations and avoiding plagiarism.
- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.
- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.

In addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:

- referencing conventions;
- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;
- attribution of contributions in group work; and
- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.

The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.

For students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual)) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, Turnitin can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)

#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules

For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:

- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)
- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)
- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the "giver" and "receiver" of material as equally culpable.

Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.

Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.

#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating

Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.

UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.

Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.

#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct

Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.

In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.

Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

### 13.10 Research ethics

Information about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)

Research ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student's research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.

All Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.

- UCL Research Ethics | UCL

### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation

Information about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.

All work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Secondmarking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.

#### Computer Science marking policies

For Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.

If a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.

### 13.12 External examining

Information about external examining at UCL.

External Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.

Each external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.

Students can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment' or 'Summary of Results and Awards') or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at cs.assessmentteam@[ucl.ac.uk.](https://ucl.ac.uk.) On the same 'My Studies' Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services (examiners@[ucl.ac.uk.](https://ucl.ac.uk.))

### 14.3 Moodle (virtual learning environment)

Information on how to access Moodle and support contacts.

Moodle is UCL's online learning space. It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.

All taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.

#### Assessment information on Moodle

Each module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team (cs.assessment-team@[ucl.ac.uk](https://ucl.ac.uk))

#### Access to Moodle pages

Students will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.

### 15.4 UCL's approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours

Information about UCL's approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours .

#### 15.4.1 Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse

Every student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.

To help with this, UCL has Report and Support , an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:

- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity or creating an intimidating environment.
- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.
- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.

If a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.

Students can request to speak to all the following advisors:

- Dignity Advisor
- Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor
- Human Resources Business Manager (if it's about a member of staff)
- Student Casework Team
- Independent Sexual Violence Advisors
- Student Support and Wellbeing

The department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.

### 16.3 Optional internships and placements

Information on optional internships that are not part of the programme

An internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.

Undergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department's postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.

#### Departmental research internships

The department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.

Industrial placement year ('year in industry')

Students who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.

#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations

Student projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's Industry Exchange Network (IXN.) Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.

### 17.3 Academic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)

Students' Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.

Every student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.

#### Course Representatives

Students from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.

#### Lead Departmental Representatives

Once Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.

#### Faculty  Representatives

Faculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.

#### Elections

Academic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better. Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.

### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee

Information on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.

Every department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year. Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement. SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative. Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study. Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.

### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back

Other ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.

#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours

Each Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.

Office hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.

- Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook

#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires

Students will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook.

#### 17.5.3 Student forum

The department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff. Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution. Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum. If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.

- Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle

### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service

### 17.7 Student complaints

Information on informal and formal student complaints.

UCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.

Before raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.

Whilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.

#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution

Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.

The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.

#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints

If an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions. Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.

Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.

The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:

- The student representative scheme , where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.)
- The student membership on UCL's committees .
- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.
- The student experience panel , through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.
- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and perprogramme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.
- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.

Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.

### 18.2 Student surveys

Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.

One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.

Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.

### 18.3 Module dialogue

Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.

Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.

These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.

### 18.4 UCL Changemakers

Information on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.

UCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:

- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.
- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.
- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.
- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.

Projects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).

### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers

Information on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.

Student Quality Reviewers, where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.

Through the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:

- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;
- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;
- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;
- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;
- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.

#### Section 20 Volunteering services

## 20. Volunteering Services

Information about the Students' Union UCL Volunteering Services and how to become involved.

### 20.1 About Volunteering Services, who they are and how a student can find out more or become involved

The Volunteering Service at Students' Union UCL exists to connect UCL students with London's Voluntary and Community Sector, primarily through volunteering. It's one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.

The Service runs three main programmes:

- Partnerships linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners.
- Student-led Projects supporting students to set up and run their own community projects.
- Community Research Initiative connecting master's students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations.

Through community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world. UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their academic study and well-being.

The Volunteering Service's opportunities can be found on its online directory, where students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by cause. There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around their studies and other commitments.

### 21.2 Storing and securing data

Students are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the Technical Support Group, for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.

If students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The UCL Dropbox service may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.

If students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.

### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)

Information on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.

#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results

A transcript is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.

##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)

Students may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.

##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)

Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.

##### Affiliate students

Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.

UCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the UCL Transcript Service.

### 23.6 Academic references

Information on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.

An academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.

Where a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.

Students should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.

### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies

Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.

A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.

Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)

In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:

undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.

Once invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a

#### Section 24 Keeping in touch

## 24. Keeping in touch

Details of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.

### 24.1 Central and Faculty communication channels

We will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:

| Channel | Descriptor |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly. |

| Channel | Descriptor |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Moodle | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |
| myUCL | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities. |
| Instagram | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community. |
| X | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community. |

### 24.2 Computer Science communications

#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams

Students will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.

Students should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.

##### Mailing lists

Students will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.

##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels

Connected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.

##### Access and technical support

Access to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.

#### 24.2.2 Social media

Computer Science is active on the following social media channels:

- Computer Science X - the department's official X channel.
- Computer Science YouTube -the department's YouTube channel.
- Computer Science LinkedIn - the department's LinkedIn page.

##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions

The Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.

##### Schedule

- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)
- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)

You can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.

We operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.

Please have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.

You will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.

##### Important:

There will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.

##### Personal Tutor Office Hours

Your Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email (b.oldfrey@[ucl.ac.uk](https://ucl.ac.uk))

### Applying for an Additional Year in Industry 2025-26

### Introduction (2)

An Additional Year in Industry (also referred to here as "Additional Placement Year", "Placement Year", and "Year in Industry Placement") is an additional credit-bearing year of study in which a student undertakes an approved Placement as part of an eligible BSc or MEng programme. The Placement must be spent attached to an organisation or institution approved by the department on behalf of UCL as having a function relevant and suitable to the student's programme of study.

### Application and eligibility

In order to be approved to undertake an Additional Year in Industry, a student must satisfy/complete all of the below. See Application Process for detailed guidance.

- Arrange their own Placement opportunity (i.e. secure an internship/ employment contract with an appropriate industry host) prior to submitting a Placement Proposal.
- Satisfy the Initial Academic Requirements .
- Submit a Placement Proposal by the deadline and have this approved.
- Submit a Placement Application by the deadline and have this approved.
- Submit a request to transfer to the Year in Industry programme and have this approved.
- Satisfy the Final Academic Requirements .

If a student is not approved to take an Additional Year in Industry (i.e. if their Placement Proposal or Application is unsuccessful), they may opt to interrupt their studies and take the internship independently (i.e. not as part of their programme); students who interrupt their studies should be aware that this may have visa implications.

### Restrictions on places

All Placement Proposals received within the application window ( Monday 17   March 2025- Friday 28 March 2025 ) will be considered. A maximum of eight Placement Proposals will be approved to proceed to the next stage of the application process; these will be approved on a first-come first serve basis according to the date/ time the successful Placement Proposal was submitted.  A reserve list will be operated in the same order (i.e. in the event that a Placement Proposal that was originally progressed is cancelled for any reason.)

### Programme structure

A Placement is usually taken between the penultimate and final year of the programme, which extends the duration of the programme by one academic year, as follows:

| BSc - No Placement | BSc - Placement between Years 2 and 3 | MEng - No Placement | MEng - Placement between Years 2 and 3 | MEng - Placement between Years 3 and 4 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Year 1 | Year 1 | Year 1 | Year 1 | Year 1 |
| Year 2 | Year 2 | Year 2 | Year 2 | Year 2 |
| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year | Year 3 | Additional Placement Year | Year 3 |
|  | Year 3 | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3 | Additional Placement Year |
|  |  |  | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 4 (MEng) |

The Placement is represented on the programme by a Placement Module, Computer Science Internship (COMP0033). The Placement Module is worth 30 credits at FHEQ Level 6, is Non-Condonable, and is weighted at 0 for the purpose of Classification.

### Curriculum and assessment

The Placement Module is assessed by a summative Placement Project (weighted at 100%), which requires students to submit a written report at the end of their placement. The written report will be submitted to the host company for approval and then to the department for marking. If a student fails the Placement Module at the First Attempt then they will be offered a Second Attempt. The Second Attempt will be a further opportunity to submit the written report. If a student fails the Placement Module at the Second Attempt then they will be transferred to their originating programme (without Year in Industry.)

### Conduct and engagement

Students on a Placement will be subject to engagement monitoring by the department. Students will be required to remain in regular contact with departmental staff throughout the duration of the placement and be responsive to communications received from staff. This is so that the department remains able to fulfil its duty of care to the student.

### Placement opportunities

Placement Year opportunities will be advertised if and when they become available; the majority of placements will be sought by the student themselves. There is no guarantee that places will be available or will be with a specific company or in a specific area. Any placement must be approved by the department and by the Faculty Education Committee, which will make sure that adequate, identifiable supervision and training are provided by the host company, that adequate supervision is provided by the student's home department, and that the student's plan of work for the year is related to the student's core discipline and is of adequate level.

### Academic Requirements

In order to be eligible to apply for and commence a placement, a student must have achieved and maintained an acceptable standard of academic performance through their programme. An applicant's performance will be evaluated at the following intervals:

1. Initial Academic Requirements: at the point of their initial application;
2. Final Academic Requirements: at the end of the year of study prior to the placement (i.e. at the point that their progression is determined.)

The department reserves the right to rescind an application at any stage where a student's academic performance falls below the level expected. In that case, the student will continue on or transfer back to their originating programme of study (i.e. without Year in Industry.)

| Academic Requirements to submit a Placement Proposal & Placement Application: | Initial Academic Requirements: Between Years 2 and 3 In order to be eligible to apply for a Year in Industry Placement between Years 2 and 3 of a BSc or MEng, a student must: Pass 120 credits in Year 1; AND Achieve a Classification Year Mean of at least 65.00% for Year 1. If a student does not meet these requirements, then they are not eligible for a Placement and should not submit a Placement Proposal or Application. Between Years 3 and 4 In order to be eligible to apply for a Year in Industry Placement between Years 3 and 4 of an MEng, a student must: Pass 240 credits over Years 1 and 2; AND Achieve a Final Weighted Mark of at least 65.00% over Years 1 and 2. If a student does not meet these requirements, then they are not eligible for a Placement and should not submit a Placement Proposal or Application. |

### Explanation of Weighted Means and Marks

### Introduction (3)

The [Academic Manual](https://[https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual)) defines how students' module marks are combined to determine their academic performance, Interim Programme Status, Progression, Award, and Classification. The Academic Manual is definitive in this regard. The information presented on the page is as an aide to understanding some of the terminologies.

### Rounding

Computer Science's taught programmes operate numerical marking scales. Credit Weighted Means, Progression Year Means, Classification Year Means, and Final Weighted Marks are calculated to 2 decimal places.

### Credit Weighted Mean

A Credit Weighted Mean (CWM) is calculated for one or more modules. It is the sum product of each Module Mark and its Credit Value as a proportion of the Total Credit value.

### Worked example

### Example marks

| Year of study | Module code | Credit value | Module mark | Included in exampleCWM |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1 | COMP0890 | 15 | 50 | Y |
| 1 | COMP0891 | 15 | 60 | Y |
| 1 | COMP0892 | 30 | 70 | Y |
| 1 | COMP0893 | 45 | 80 |  |
| 1 | COMP0895 | 15 | 90 |  |

### Example calculation

This example calculates a CWM over a subset of Modules Marks within the same Year of Study (with a Total Credit value of 60 credits):

### Usage

A Credit Weighted Mean may be used to determine a student's interim progress, for example to assess their eligibility for programme transfer or for applying for an internship. CWMs for different purposes may factor different subsets of Module Marks.

### Progression Year Mean

A Progression Year Mean (PYM) is calculated for a Year of Study. It is the Credit Weighted Mean of all Module Marks in that Year of Study.

### Worked example (2)

### Example marks (2)

| Year of study | Module code | Credit value | Module mark | Included in example |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Year 1 | COMP0890 | 15 | 50 | Y |
| Year 1 | COMP0891 | 15 | 60 | Y |
| Year 1 | COMP0892 | 30 | 70 | Y |
| Year 1 | COMP0893 | 45 | 80 | Y |
| Year 1 | COMP0895 | 15 | 90 | Y |

### Example calculation (2)

This example calculates a PYM over all Modules Marks within the same Year of Study (with a Total Credit Value of 120 credits in this case):

### Usage (2)

A Progression Year Mean is primarily used to determine a student's Progression on an undergraduate programme with multiple Years of Study.

### Classification Year Mean

A Classification Year Mean (CYM) is calculated for a Year of Study. It is the Credit Weighted Mean of all Module Marks in that Year of Study that count towards Award Classification (as determined by that programme's Classification Scheme and any applicable No Detriment Regulations.)

### Worked example (3)

### Example marks (3)

| Year of study | Module code | Credit value | Module mark | Included in example |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Year 2 | COMP0896 | 15 | 50 |  |
| Year 2 | COMP0897 | 15 | 60 |  |
| Year 2 | COMP0898 | 15 | 70 |  |
| Year 2 | COMP0899 | 30 | 80 | Y |
| Year 2 | COMP0900 | 15 | 90 | Y |
| Year 2 | COMP0901 | 15 | 95 | Y |

### Example calculation (3)

This example calculates a CYM over all counting Modules Marks within the same Year of Study (where the counting Module Marks are the best 60 credits in this case):

### Usage (3)

A Classification Year Mean is primarily used, as component of the Final Weighted Mark , to determine a student's Award Classification. A Classification Year Mean may be calculated over Module Marks from multiple Years of Study for the purpose of determining a student's eligibility for applying for or commencing a Year in Industry (the CYM is not Year Weighted when calculated in this way.)

### Final Weighted Mark

A Final Weighted Mark (FWM) is calculated for multiple Years of Study. It is a Year-Weighted Mean of the Classification Year Means (where the Year Weightings are determined by that programme's Classification Scheme.)

### Worked example (4)

### Example marks (4)

| Year of study | Module code | Credit value | Module mark | Included in example |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0701 | 15 | 90 | Y |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0702 | 15 | 80 | Y |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0703 | 15 | 75 | Y |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0704 | 15 | 60 | Y |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0705 | 30 | 70 | Y |
| Year 1 Year weighting: 1 | COMP0706 | 30 | 70 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0601 | 15 | 70 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0602 | 15 | 60 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0603 | 15 | 50 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0604 | 15 | 75 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0605 | 30 | 80 | Y |
| Year 2 Year weighting: | COMP0606 | 30 | 85 | Y |

### Example calculation (4)

This example calculates a FWM over the Years of Study 1 and 2 (and where each Classification Year Mean includes all Module Marks in that Year of Study):

### Usage (4)

A Final Weighted Mark is primarily used to determine a student's Award Classification. A Final Weighted Mark may be calculated over a subset of a programme's Years of Study for the purpose of determining a student's eligibility for applying for or commencing a Year in Industry or progressing on an MEng programme.
