## 5. Hours of study

Information on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)

### 5.1 Teaching and learning

Information on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)

Students on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.

Synchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.

#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons

There is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)

### 5.2 Personal study

Information on personal study time (Local.)

Activities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.

### 5.3 Attendance and engagement

Information on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)

#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements

UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.

The Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.

Each Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)

Students should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.

Students encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.

#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities

In line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.

#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment

If a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under theÂ [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).
