### UCL careers

Information on UCL’s careers services for current students and recent graduates.

[UCL Careers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/careers/) provides a wide variety of careers information, one-to-one guidance and events for UCL students and recent graduates. UCL Careers assists them through the entire job hunting process, including exploring options, searching for vacancies, preparing CVs and applications, practicing for interviews, aptitude tests or assessment centres, and providing access to recruitment fairs and other employment-related events. They can also advise on exploring options for further study and funding. Services and events are available to all taught students, researchers (PhD students and postdocs) and graduates (for up to three years after course completion).

UCL Careers also supports employability activities within departments such as work-related learning and internships.

UCL students are helped with applications and sourcing opportunities with web resources and advice. They can book appointments and search for internship and graduate job vacancies via [myUCLCareers](https://ucl.targetconnect.net/).

### Optional internships and placements

Information on optional internships that are not part of the programme.

An internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.

Undergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.

#### Departmental research internships

The department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.

#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')

Students who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.

#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations

Student projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.

### Entrepreneurship at UCL

Information on entrepreneurship and enterprise at UCL.

UCL has a long and successful track record of supporting spin-outs and start-ups developed by its academic and student communities. Many of the student and staff entrepreneurs have won external awards and achieved substantial investment allowing their enterprises to grow and reach their full potential. [UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/) offers a wide range of support to students ranging from training programmes, advice on whether an idea has commercial potential, one-to-one sessions with business advisers, funding, competitions and incubator space to help them start or grow their business.
