## UCL's Student Support Framework

Details of how UCL and the department will support students through their studies.

### About the UCL Student Support Framework

UCL is committed to providing the support students need in order to make the most out of their studies. The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them.

- [UCL's Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)

The Framework includes the following components:

#### Part 1: How to Use this Framework

Helps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes:
- Where to find help and advice
- Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student)
- Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data
- Information on providing supporting evidence
- Links to other support options that are available to students.

#### Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works:

| Support process                                                    | Use this if                                                                                                                                                   | What this covers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Delayed Assessment Scheme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Delayed-Assessment-Scheme)                                                 | You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC's.  | Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. |
| [Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Extenuating-Circumstances)           | You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence.                                               | 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. |
| [Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Reasonable-Adjustments) | You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition.                                                                                       | UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a 'SoRA' (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL's Student Support and Wellbeing team.                                                                                                                                                |
| [Academic Adjustments](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Academic-Adjustments)                                                         | You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following: You or your partner is pregnant or planning maternity, paternity or adoption leave; You are a parent or carer; You observe religious beliefs or cultural customs; You are affected by any form of harassment or discrimination; You are affected by traumatic world events such as war or terrorism; You are a critical worker (e.g. NHS staff). | Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need additional support with learning, teaching and assessment                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Exam Adjustments](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Exam-Adjustments)                                                               | You need additional support to sit an online or face-to- face exam.                                                                                           | Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take-Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. |
| [Interruption of Study](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Interruption-of-Study)                                                            | You are thinking of taking time out from your studies.                                                                                            | Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. |
| [Support to Study](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Support-to-Study)                                                                  | You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL's other support processes are not providing the right level of help.                         | Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer-term difficulties and UCL's normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support. We will work with you to put together a Support Plan to help you get the most out of your studies. |

The Student Support Framework is just one of the ways in which UCL helps students to get the most out of their time with us:
