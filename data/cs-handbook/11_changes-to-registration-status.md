## Changes to registration status

Information on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.

### Changing registration status

Students wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.

Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.

### Changing programme

Students wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.

Students must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](

#### Study Abroad and Placement Years

Students who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](

### Interruption of studies

Students needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.

Students who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.

Note: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.

### Withdrawing from a programme

Students wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.

Students who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.

Applications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.

### Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status

If a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.

If a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.

### Key contacts for changes to programme registration status

If a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.
