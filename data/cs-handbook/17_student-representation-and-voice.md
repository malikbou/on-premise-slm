## 17. Student representation and voice

### 17.1 Students' Union UCL

Information on UCL Students' Union, how to run for election and how to find a student representative.

[Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/) helps you to do more at UCL, experience something you've always dreamt of, turn a curiosity into a new passion and help you reach your potential.  The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.

The Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students.  It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL.  All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students.  The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students.  Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.

### 17.2 Student clubs & societies

Information on student societies.

At Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in.  Maybe you are interested in sports with our TeamUCL clubs or low commitment exercise with our Project Active scheme? Perhaps you are keen to perform on-stage in the Bloomsbury Theatre or you want to learn about and celebrate different cultures?  With such a diverse offering available there is bound to be something that sparks your interest!  Clubs and societies are a great way to develop your skills and find a community at UCL.  The Welcome Fair in early October is the perfect chance to meet them all in one place and learn more about what they have on offer!

#### UCL Technology Society

The society most relevant to Computer Science is the [Technology Society (TechSoc)](https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/technology-society), which has a large number of members from the department.  TechSoc puts on a full programme of events, from workshops to hackathons, tech talks by external speakers, and other social events.

### 17.3 Academic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)

Students' Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL.  One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.

Every student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.

#### Course Representatives

Students from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.

#### Lead Departmental Representatives

Once Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.

#### Faculty  Representatives

Faculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.

#### Elections

Academic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.

### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee

Information on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.

Every department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.

### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back

Other ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.

#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours

Each Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.

Office hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.

- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](

#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires

Students will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](

#### 17.5.3 Student forum

The department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.

### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service

Information on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.

The [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:
- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework
- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries
- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes
- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts
- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds

The service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.  No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission.   Students can complete the [online contact form](https://studentsunionucl.org/forms/advice-service-contact-form) for advice and support.

### 17.7 Student complaints

Information on informal and formal student complaints.

UCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL.  However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.

Before raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.

Whilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.

#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution

Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.

| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |
|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |
|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |
|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |

Contact details are available as follows:
- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).

- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).

Though we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.

#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints

If an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.
