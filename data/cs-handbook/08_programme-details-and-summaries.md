### Programme features and variations

#### Integrated Engineering Programme

Information on the Integrated Engineering Programme for participating undergraduate programmes.

The Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP) is a framework of modules and activities taken by students on participating undergraduate programmes across the Faculty of Engineering Sciences. The following Computer Science programmes participate in the IEP:
- BSc Computer Science
- BSc Computer Science (with Year in Industry)
- MEng Computer Science
- MEng Computer Science (with Year in Industry)

##### Structure of programmes within the IEP

The IEP includes compulsory modules, an IEP Minor pathway, and the How to Change the World activity, which is structured as follows:

| Year of Study | IEP components                                                              |
| :---          | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Year 1        | Design and Professional Skills (ENGF0001), Engineering Challenges (ENGF0034) |
| Year 2        | IEP Minor module 1, How to Change the World (credited in Year 3)            |
| Year 3        | IEP Minor module 2, IEP Minor module 3                                      |

The IEP Minor is a set of three linked modules in an engineering or other complimentary discipline (such as modern languages.). Students take the first module of their chosen Minor in Year 2 and the second and third modules of that Minor in Year 3. Students cannot change their Minor once commenced in Year 2.

#### Integrated Study Abroad Year

Information on Integrated Study Abroad Year options for eligible MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Study Abroad Year, the academic requirements for taking a Year Abroad, and how to apply.

An Integrated Study Abroad Year is one undertaken at an approved international partner institution in Year 3 of a 4-Year MEng programme. Students follow the Year 3 curriculum of the partner institution (instead of the Year 3 UCL curriculum) and then resume the standard MEng curriculum when they return to UCL in Year 4.

##### Structure of programmes with an Integrated Study Abroad Year

The structure of programmes including a Study Abroad Year is as follows:

| BSc    | MEng          | MEng (with Integrated Study Abroad Year) |
| :----- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Year 1 | Year 1        | Year 1                                   |
| Year 2 | Year 2        | Year 2                                   |
| Year 3 | Year 3        | Year 3 (Study Abroad)                    |
|        | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 4 (MEng)                            |

Students in Year 2 of MEng Computer Science and MEng Mathematical Computation may apply for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students in Year 2 of BSc Computer Science students must transfer to the MEng Computer Science programme in parallel to making an application for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students who are approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year will transfer to the corresponding MEng (International Programme), which includes the Study Abroad Year.

##### Guidance and application

Students should review the [UCL Go abroad website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/go-abroad/) to learn more about the ethos of the programme and whether it may be right for them. Those who may be interested in applying a Study Abroad Year should then seek advice from the Study Abroad Tutor.

#### Additional Placement Year

Information about taking an Additional Placement Year for eligible BSc and MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Year in Industry, the academic requirements for taking a Year in Industry, and how to apply.

An Additional Placement Year is one undertaken working in industry between the penultimate and final year of a BSc or MEng programme. Students resume the standard curriculum when they return to UCL in the next year; this extends the length of the degree by one year.

##### Structure of programmes with an Additional Placement Year

| BSc    | BSc (Placement in between Years 2 and 3) | MEng          | MEng (Placement between Years 2 and 3) | MEng (Placement between Years 3 and 4) |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Year 1 | Year 1                                   | Year 1        | Year 1                                 | Year 1                                 |
| Year 2 | Year 2                                   | Year 2        | Year 2                                 | Year 2                                 |
| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year                | Year 3        | Additional Placement Year              | Year 3                                 |
|        | Year 3                                   | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3                                 | Additional Placement Year              |
|        |                                          |               | Year 4 (MEng)                          | Year 4 (MEng)                          |

Students who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.

##### Guidance and application (2)

Students should review the [UCL Research-based education website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/research-based-education) to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.

#### Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects

Information about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.

Students will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the [UCL Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.

### Professional accreditation and certification

Many UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally-recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.

### Module details

Programmes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).
