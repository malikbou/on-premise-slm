## Progression, award, and classification

Information on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.

### Progression and award requirements

Information on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.

A programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.

| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |
| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |

The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure. Specific regulations for programmes are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool.

Students will be notified when the regulations for their programme are available. To find the Tool, click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.

#### MEng Computer Science progression threshold

In order to progress on MEng Computer Science, a student must have achieved the following, in addition to all other progression criteria:

1.  At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.
2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.

These thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.

### Classification requirements

Information on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.

If a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).

If a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.

The regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their programme regulations are available. To find the Tool, students should click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.
