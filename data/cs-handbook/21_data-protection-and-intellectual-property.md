### 21.1 Data protection (how UCL uses student information)

UCL uses student information for a range of purposes, including the provision of teaching and learning, managing accommodation and ensuring health and safety. Further information about how UCL uses student information can be found in the [UCL General Student Privacy Notice](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/general-student-privacy-notice).

Students may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk).)

### 21.2 Storing and securing data

Students are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the [Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg), for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.

If students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The [UCL Dropbox service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/dropbox-ucl) may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.

If students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.
