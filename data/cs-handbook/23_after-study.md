### Summary of options for confirmation of student status and award

Students and graduates may request evidence of their student status and academic record from UCL, including official statements, transcripts of results, and academic references. The [certificates and results pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates) set out detailed guidance on the types of documentation available, how to request these, and any restrictions that apply. The table below is intended to summarise that information; best efforts have been made to ensure it is correct.

Any module results and programme outcomes are provisional until confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners, and any recommended award is provisional until conferred by UCL Education Committee.

Typically, the Board of Examiners meets once in the summer to confirm marks for modules taken in terms 1, 2, and 3 (including undergraduate projects/ dissertations), once in the late summer to confirm the results of late summer assessments, and once in the autumn to confirm marks for taught postgraduate projects/ dissertations.

Where a student's full set of module results is not available at a meeting of the programme Board of Examiners, for example because of an ongoing extension, deferral, or unresolved investigation under the academic misconduct regulations, then confirmation of results and conferral of any award may be delayed, subject to the availability of the Board of Examiners to review the delayed results. The department will endeavour to minimise any such delays and to make any recommendations for award as expeditiously as possible.

### Confirmation of student status (statement of student status)

A statement of student status is an official letter that can used as proof of enrolment at UCL. The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.

Students can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)

### Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)

Information on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.

#### Transcripts of results

A [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.

##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)

Students may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.

##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)

Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.

##### Affiliate students

Students will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.

UCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).

#### Degree certificates

A [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.

Graduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.

- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)

#### Statements of award

A statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.

Students can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)

### Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)

Information about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)

A [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.

New students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).

Each summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.

### Academic references

Information on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.

An academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.

Where a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.

Students should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.

### Graduation ceremonies

Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.

A [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.

Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)

In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:
- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;
- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.

Once invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)

### UCL Alumni community

Information on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.

An alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.

As UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.
