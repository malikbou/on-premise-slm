There are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online [UCL Student of Concern Form](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/raising-concerns-about-student).

Depending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.

The [Ridgmount Practice](https://www.ridgmountpractice.nhs.uk/) is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus).

The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Team aims to acknowledge, understand, and tackle structural inequities and unjust social power imbalances that affect our communities across the institution. This means recognising how we got here and what needs to be done to ensure equity, inclusion and belonging for those who are not systemically privileged by our society. UCL is a place where people can be authentic and their unique perspective, experiences and skills seen as a valuable asset to the institution.

The [Equity, Diversity & Inclusion website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/equality-diversity-inclusion/) brings together a range of information on issues relating to race, gender, religion and belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability amongst other equalities initiatives at UCL.

### 15.4 UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours

Information about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours.

#### 15.4.1 Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse

Every student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.

To help with this, UCL has [Report and Support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/report-support/), an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:
- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment.
- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.
- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.

If a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.

Students can request to speak to all the following advisors:
- Dignity Advisor
- Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor
- Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff)
- Student Casework Team
- Independent Sexual Violence Advisors
- Student Support and Wellbeing

The department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.

#### 15.4.2 Support for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse

UCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by [sexual violence and/or domestic abuse](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/sexual-misconduct-and-violence). If a student would like to talk to somebody at UCL, the Student Support and Wellbeing Team can offer advice on the support available both internally and externally.
