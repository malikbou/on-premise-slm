Information about the Students' Union UCL Sports clubs and Project Active initiatives.

### TeamUCL

With 75 Sports Clubs and our very own TeamUCL Sports Leagues, we operate one of the largest university sport programmes in the UK.  There are opportunities to learn sports as a beginner, compete for TeamUCL at a national level in British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS), or join a department or society team to play against other UCL students in the TeamUCL leagues:
