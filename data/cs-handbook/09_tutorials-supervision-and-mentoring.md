## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring

Information on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)

### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring

UCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.

#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring

##### Support via Personal Tutoring

As part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.

At the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.

Students should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.

Tutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.

### 9.2 Transition mentoring

Information on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.

The UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned aÂ Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.

First-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.

### 9.3 Programming tutoring

Information on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.

All Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.

The scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.
