CLIE also heads the [UCL Academic Communication Centre (ACC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-communication-centre/). The ACC offers discipline-specific academic communication support to both native and non-native English speakers currently studying an undergraduate or postgraduate degree at UCL. Evening courses are offered in nine foreign languages across a range of levels to support UCL students, staff and London’s wider academic and professional community. Students can access language-learning resources online through the [CLIE Self-Access Centre](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/clie/self-access/catalogue), including films and documentaries and books for self-study.

#### Sustainability at UCL

UCL launched its Sustainability Strategy in 2019 – one of the most ambitious across the UK higher education sector. It includes many headline commitments – to be a net zero carbon institution by 2030; to be single use plastic free; and that every student has the opportunity to engage with sustainability during their time at UCL. The [Sustainable UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/) team offers students many different opportunities to learn about sustainability as part of their studies or extracurricular activities.

In particular, students can engage with sustainability in their free-time by joining one of UCL’s green clubs and societies or taking part in [UCL’s Student Sustainability Council](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/your-representatives/student-sustainability-council) to help direct UCL’s sustainability vision and represent the students’ voice on sustainability.

### Departmental, Faculty, and other library and learning resources

Information on departmental and faculty library resources, IT provision/ support, social spaces etc.

Students will be able to access many of the literature and other digital resources they need online via UCL Library Services. For students on campus, there are a range of study spaces available via the Student Centre and other UCL libraries.

The [UCL Science Library](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/sites/science-library) houses collections relating to a range of scientific disciplines, including Engineering and Computer Science, and provides access to quite study spaces, bookable group study rooms, the Learning Laboratory (the largest computer cluster at UCL), a postgraduate cluster room, printing and photocopying facilities, and technical support.

### Moodle (virtual learning environment)

Information on how to access Moodle and support contacts.

[Moodle](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/moodle/) is UCL's online learning space. It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.

All taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.

#### Assessment information on Moodle

Each module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)).

#### Access to Moodle pages

Students will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.

### Portico

Information on Portico – what it is, why it is important and who to contact for support.

[Portico](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/portico/) is the main UCL student information system which is used by both staff and students. Students will use Portico for:
- updating personal data such as addresses or contact numbers;
- completing pre-enrolment and enrolment;
- completing online module registration;
- viewing information about programmes/ modules;
- viewing confirmed module results and programme outcomes once they have been released by UCL Academic Services;
- completing changes to registration status, including programme transfers, interruptions, and withdrawals;
- submitting Extenuating Circumstances applications;
- planning and recording skills development; and
- applying for graduation ceremonies.

It is essential that students keep their contact details up to date on Portico to ensure they receive important information from the university, including their final transcript and, if they are conferred an award, their degree certificate.

### Research Student Log (MRes only)

Information on the Research Student Log, which applies for MRes students.

To fulfil UCL’s commitment to the quality of its research programmes, the Doctoral School provides the [Research Student Log](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/doctoral-school/research-student-log) for the use of all research students at UCL. The Log is a mandatory component of all UCL research degree programmes (including the MRes) and has been prepared to assist students throughout their degree programme at UCL. It provides a framework for recording details related to the student’s graduate research programme, scheduled supervisory meetings and activities concerning the development of academic and key skills. The Log will also help students to assess their progress and to plan and chart evidence of the development of academic and discipline-specific skills and key skills.
