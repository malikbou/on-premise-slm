Information on UCL's health, safety and security policies and procedures.

### 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL

UCL's overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL's activities are managed and conducted.

There are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment:
- [UCL Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl), who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;
- [UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/), who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples;
- [UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/) who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.

### 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science

The policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.

The department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.

### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department

Students should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.
