## 18. Student feedback

### 18.1 The role of student feedback

The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.

Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.

The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:
- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](
- The student membership on UCL's committees.
- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.
- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.
- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.
- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.

Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.

### 18.2 Student surveys

Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.

One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.

Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.

### 18.3 Module dialogue

Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.

Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.

These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.

### 18.4 UCL Changemakers

Information on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.

[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:
- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.
- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.
- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.
- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.

Projects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).

### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers

Information on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.

[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.

Through the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:
- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;
- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;
- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;
- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;
- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.
