## Assessment and feedback

Information on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.

### Assessment

#### Overview of assessment

All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.

A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.

Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.

A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.

#### Assessment structure

Each module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.

An example assessment pattern for a module:

| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |
| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |
| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |

Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.

Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.

- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)

#### Assessment tasks and their deadlines

Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.

Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.

##### Deliverables

An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.

Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)

##### Individual and group work

An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)

Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.

The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.

##### Engagement in group assessment activity

All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.

Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.

##### Learning outcomes

Each programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.

A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).

##### Marking criteria

Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.

Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.

Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.

- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)

#### Marking scales

Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.

Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.

Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.

- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)

### Feedback

#### Feedback and provisional marks

Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.

##### UCL feedback policy

It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.

If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.

##### Computer Science feedback policy

For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.

For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.

The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.

##### Computer Science exam script policy

UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.

##### Computer Science provisional marks policy

UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)

### Examinations

Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.

An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

Please check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.

#### Examination scheduling

Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.

The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:
- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025
- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025

The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.

#### Examination conduct

Students must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.

- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)
- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)
- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)

#### Intercollegiate examinations

UCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).

#### Computer Science past exam paper policy

[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.

The department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.

### Coursework

Information on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.

Coursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.

Most modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.

#### Coursework scheduling

Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:
- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)
- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)

Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.

#### Coursework submission

Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.

Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.

#### Support for coursework submission

Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.

Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.

### Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations

Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.

Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)

However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.

The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.

#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure

If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.

- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)

#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission

Work is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.

For assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:

| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |
| 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late.                                                                                                                                              | Component mark capped at the module pass mark.                                     |                                                                                                                    |
| Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) | Component mark of 1.00%.                                                           | Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                    |
| Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners.                                                                       | Component mark of zero.                                                            | Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                          |

Work submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.

#### Application of late penalties

Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.

- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)

### Penalties for exceeding word count limits

Information about word count limits and penalties.

Assessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.

For project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.

#### Application of word count penalties

Word count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.

- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)

### Absence from assessments

Information about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.

Examinations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.

If a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.

#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure

If a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.

- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)

### Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)

Information on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.

Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:
1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);
2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;
3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or
4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.

#### Condonement

Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.

Students who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.

A student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.

- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)
- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)
- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)
- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](

#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)

Where a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.

Depending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:
- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.
- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.
- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.

Arrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.

The marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)

- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)
- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)
- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)

#### Deferred assessment

If an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.

If a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.

### Academic integrity

Information about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.

#### Academic standards and integrity

High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.

In particular, students should familiarise themselves with:
- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).
- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.
- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.
- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.

In addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:
- referencing conventions;
- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;
- attribution of contributions in group work; and
- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.

The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.

For students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)

#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules

For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:
- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)
- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)
- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the "giver" and "receiver" of material as equally culpable.

Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.

Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.

#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating

Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.

UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.

Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.

#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct

Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.

In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.

Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

### Research ethics

Information about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)

Research ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.

All Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.

### Marking, second-marking, and moderation

Information about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.

All work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.

#### Computer Science marking policies

For Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.

If a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.

### External examining

Information about external examining at UCL.

External Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.

Each external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.

Students can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)
