## Keeping in touch

Details of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.

### Central and Faculty communication channels

We will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:

| Channel           | Descriptor                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly.          |
| Moodle            | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |
| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |
| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |
| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |

### Computer Science communications

#### Email, Moodle, and Teams

Students will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.

Students should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.

##### Mailing lists

Students will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.

##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels

Connected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.

##### Access and technical support

Access to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.

#### Social media

Computer Science is active on the following social media channels:
- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.
- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.
- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.

- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)
- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)
- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)

##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions

The Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.

##### Schedule

- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)
- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)

You can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.

We operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.

Please have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.

You will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.

##### Important:

There will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.

##### Personal Tutor Office Hours

Your Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email ([b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk))
