## Introduction and welcome

Welcome messages from UCL's President and Provost and the Computer Science Head of Department, information about the scope and purpose of the Student Handbook, and general advice about changes to information through the year.

### Provost's welcome

Dear students,

A warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back.

Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future.

We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL's research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges.

I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better.  Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience.

This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.

UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.

Dr Michael Spence

UCL President and Provost

### Head of Department's welcome

Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science.

Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.

It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.

One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.

So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.

I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.

Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department

### Teaching and Learning Team welcome

A warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.

We are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.

In addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.

You have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.

A key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.

You can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.

Best wishes for the year ahead.

Lewis Griffin & Jo Stiles

Departmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager

### About the Student Handbook

The Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.

Where information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.

You should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.
