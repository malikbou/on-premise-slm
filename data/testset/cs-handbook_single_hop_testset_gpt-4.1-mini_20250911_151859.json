      "Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\nModules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\nModule availability\n\nModules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\nModules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\nComputer Science | Study Abroad at UCL\n\nModule registration for affiliates | UCL Students\n\nModule selection\n\nChoosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment.\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\nModule selection | UCL Students\n\nApproval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\nChange of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\nVerification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\nChoosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\nPortico | UCL\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nContinuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students\n\nAvailability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nSection 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual\n\nModule information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\nModule catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.\n\nThe UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\nModule deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\nModule timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\nKey contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\nAcademic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\nAcademic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\nAdministrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator."

Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\nAcademic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\nGraduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\nUCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All UCL alumni can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\nServices for Alumni | UCL\n\nAlumni of the department | UCL Computer Science"

The team coordinates a diverse portfolio of global student opportunities via different projects: Student Exchanges and Exchange Agreements, the Turing Scheme, Global Experience (Summer Schools, volunteering abroad, short-term mobility).\n\nGo Abroad | UCL Students\n\nAccommodation\n\nUCL Accommodation provides a range of housing options which includes two Halls of Residence (catered), self-catered Student Houses and Intercollegiate Halls (both catered and self-catered) shared with other colleges of the University of London. Each Hall has a designated Warden supported by a number of live-in Student Residence Advisers (SRA) to provide support for students and to foster a positive environment within the accommodation.\n\nAccommodation | UCL Students\n\nFinancial support\n\nThe UCL Student Funding Office provides a central service aimed at supporting students with money matters. We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers.\n\nSupport for financial issues | UCL Students\n\nStudent of Concern\n\nThere are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.\n\nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.\n\nSupport for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students\n\nOther sources of support\n\nInformation about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services.\n\nRegistering with a doctor\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to register with a doctor as soon as possible after they arrive in London so that they can access healthcare quickly if they become ill or injured. When attending a university in the UK students under the age of 25 are also advised to be vaccinated against meningitis (ACWY).\n\nThe Ridgmount Practice is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus). Students can also choose to register with a practice closer to where they live if they prefer. The Ridgmount Practice also runs a walk-in surgery which any UCL student can attend, even if they are not registered with the practice.\n\nCounselling, support and information helpline\n\nAs part of a partnership with an organisation external to UCL, we provide an information and counselling helpline. The 24/7 Student Support Line is free of charge and includes access to information specialists who are trained by Citizens Advice and to professionally qualified and BACP accredited counsellors who can help students with a range of emotional and psychological difficulties.\n\nMental health and wellbeing crisis support (immediate and urgent help)\n\nIf a student needs urgent help themselves or are concerned that someone else does, they should reach out immediately to get the support required.\n\nEmergencies - immediate danger of harm\n\nIf anyone is in immediate danger, experiencing a mental health or wellbeing crisis and is in immediate risk of harming themselves or someone else then call the UK Emergency Services directly on 999 (or +44 (0)20 7230 1212 internationally) (or alternatively those who are deaf or hard of hearing can use the UK textphone service on 18000.) An ambulance will be able to bring the person in crisis directly to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) department of their local hospital to get urgent help. For students in the UK, University College Hospital (UCH) is the nearest A&E department to campus and has a dedicated mental health unit.\n\nUrgent support - students in distress\n\nIf a someone is feeling distressed, urgent medical support can be obtained by contacting: - The student’s GP surgery to request an emergency appointment. - The free NHS out-of-hours medical line on 111. - The Samaritans on 116 123 to talk to someone at any time, day or night. - The Nightline service on +44 (0) 207 631 0101 to talk to someone overnight during term time.\n\nFurther sources of support are available via the Crisis support | UCL Students pages.\n\nIf assisting someone in accessing crisis support and there are concerns for their wellbeing or safety, please complete the Student of Concern Form to inform Student Support and Wellbeing providing as much information as possible. The Student Support and Wellbeing Team will treat any such reports with sensitivity and will seek to provide appropriate support to the student concerned.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion support\n\nInformation on how students can access support/ information related to Equality and Diversity.\n\nThe Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Team aims to acknowledge, understand, and tackle structural inequities and unjust social power imbalances that affect our communities across the institution. This means recognising how we got here and what needs to be done to ensure equity, inclusion and belonging for those who are not systemically privileged by our society. UCL is a place where people can be authentic and their unique perspective, experiences and skills seen as a valuable asset to the institution.\n\nThe Equity, Diversity & Inclusion website brings together a range of information on issues relating to race, gender, religion and belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability amongst other equalities initiatives at UCL.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion at Computer Science\n\nAt UCL Computer Science, we are committed to supporting and promoting equity, diversity and inclusion. We believe in inspiring, empowering and engaging people from all backgrounds, cultures, identities and abilities and creating fair opportunities for all our students and staff members.\n\nThe department has established an EDI Committee, with staff and student members, which aims to develop a long-term EDI strategy, identify and propose long, medium and short-term priorities, and draw up action plans enhance EDI within our community.\n\nInclusion Leads also provide support and assistance for students and staff on issues relating to equalities and diversity.\n\nEquity, Diversity & Inclusion | UCL Computer Science\n\nUCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours\n\nInformation about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours.\n\nBullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse\n\nEvery student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to: - Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment. - Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal. - Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.\n\nStudents can request to speak to all the following advisors: - Dignity Advisor - Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor - Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff) - Student Casework Team - Independent Sexual Violence Advisors - Student Support and Wellbeing\n\nThe department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.\n\nSupport for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse\n\nUCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by sexual violence and/or domestic abuse. If a student would like to talk to somebody at UCL, the Student Support and Wellbeing Team can offer advice on the support available both internally and externally."

Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students Module selection Choosing modules for 2024-25 Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment. Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible. Module selection | UCL Students Approval of selections Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process. Change of selections Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader. Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico. Verification of selections Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.) Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students) Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer. Portico | UCL Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students Availability and allocation of places Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints. Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective. Within those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module. All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action. Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual Module information Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.

Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme. Module timetable Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study. Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other. Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week. Key contacts for module selection Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise. Academic advice on module selection For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor. Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department. Academic advice on specific modules For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue. Administrative advice and troubleshooting If a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator."

A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification. Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.) In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.
