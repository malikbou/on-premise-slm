Modules Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.) Compulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests. Module availability Modules for Computer Science students The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups. Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students) Ancillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director. Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange) Affiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration.

All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action. Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual Module information Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study. Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme."

Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.

Each summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account. Academic references Information on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study. An academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references. Where a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines. Students should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year. Graduation ceremonies Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies. A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification. Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.) In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date. Once invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)"

      "Student Advisers for First Year Undergraduates UCL Student Advisers are a key contact for first-year undergraduates for any wellbeing, support and student experience matters. They can help students navigate any aspects of student life that may appear challenging, including policies, assessments and finding the right kind of support. All UCL departments have dedicated Student Advisers who make contact with students before the start of the academic year to introduce their role and offer individual appointments. Meet the Student Advisers | UCL Students Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing team The Disability, Mental Health and Wellbeing Team in Student Support and Wellbeing (SSW) provide a safe, confidential and non-judgemental space, in which students can discuss any wellbeing, mental health and/or disability concerns that may be affecting their ability to study. This encompasses any personal or emotional challenges students may be experiencing, mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression and long-term health conditions. The service also supports students with physical and sensory impairments, specific learning difficulties, and autistic spectrum conditions. As well as arranging for adjustments to learning environments, the team loan out specialist equipment. They provide one-to-one tutoring and support for students with specific learning difficulties and mentoring for students with mental health conditions. Support for disabled students | UCL Students Support for wellbeing and mental health | UCL Students Student Psychological and Counselling Services Student Psychological and Counselling Services (SPCS) is dedicated to helping UCL students with personal, emotional and psychological concerns. The SPCS team is diverse and consists of a variety of highly trained and experienced professionals, who offer short-term CBT and psychodynamic support.

      "Accommodation UCL Accommodation provides a range of housing options which includes two Halls of Residence (catered), self-catered Student Houses and Intercollegiate Halls (both catered and self-catered) shared with other colleges of the University of London. Each Hall has a designated Warden supported by a number of live-in Student Residence Advisers (SRA) to provide support for students and to foster a positive environment within the accommodation. Accommodation | UCL Students Financial support The UCL Student Funding Office provides a central service aimed at supporting students with money matters. We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers. Support for financial issues | UCL Students Student of Concern There are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form. Depending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe. Support for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students Other sources of support Information about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services. Registering with a doctor Students are strongly encouraged to register with a doctor as soon as possible after they arrive in London so that they can access healthcare quickly if they become ill or injured. When attending a university in the UK students under the age of 25 are also advised to be vaccinated against meningitis (ACWY). The Ridgmount Practice is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus). Students can also choose to register with a practice closer to where they live if they prefer. The Ridgmount Practice also runs a walk-in surgery which any UCL student can attend, even if they are not registered with the practice. Counselling, support and information helpline As part of a partnership with an organisation external to UCL, we provide an information and counselling helpline. The 24/7 Student Support Line is free of charge and includes access to information specialists who are trained by Citizens Advice and to professionally qualified and BACP accredited counsellors who can help students with a range of emotional and psychological difficulties."

      "UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours Information about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse Every student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly. To help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options. Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to: - Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment. - Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal. - Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access. If a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis. Students can request to speak to all the following advisors: - Dignity Advisor - Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor - Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff) - Student Casework Team - Independent Sexual Violence Advisors - Student Support and Wellbeing The department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.

      "Assessment and feedback Information on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks. Assessment Overview of assessment All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes. A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation. Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module. A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module. Assessment structure Each module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'. An example assessment pattern for a module: # Method (or type) Title Weight (%) 1 Coursework Coursework 1 15 2 Coursework Coursework 2 25 3 Open book examination Online remote examination 60 Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section. Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period. Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual"

    "reference_contexts": [
      "Assessment tasks and their deadlines Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them. Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks. Deliverables An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables. Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.) Individual and group work An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.) Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task. The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment. Engagement in group assessment activity All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately. Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published."

      "Learning outcomes Each programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes. A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue. Marking criteria Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out. Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort. Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum. Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual Marking scales Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment. Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark. Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module. Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual Feedback Feedback and provisional marks Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning.

      "UCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.

Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark. Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module. Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual Feedback Feedback and provisional marks Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation. UCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice. Please check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information. Examination scheduling Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms. The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: - Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 - Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025 The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.

      "Coursework scheduling Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: - Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) - Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.) Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section. Coursework submission Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere. Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline. Support for coursework submission Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience. Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies. Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time. Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.) However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies. The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible."

If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late. UCL’s Student Support Framework Late penalties & latest permissible submission Work is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted. For assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows: Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline) Description of penalty to apply Notes Less than 2 working days late. Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late. Component mark capped at the module pass mark.

Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided. Work submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission. Application of late penalties Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied.

Examinations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time. If a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.

Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual  Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats) Information on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts. Students are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might: 1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme); 2. be required to resit failed components of the module; 3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or 4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures. Condonement Condonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met. Students who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed. A student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.

Depending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat: - Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period. - Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components. - Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees. Arrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners. The marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)

Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual Academic integrity Information about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures. Academic standards and integrity High academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary. In particular, students should familiarise themselves with: - the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage. - the UCL Moodle course 'Introduction to Academic Integrity'. - examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website. - Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set. In addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example: - referencing conventions; - opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others; - attribution of contributions in group work; and - any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission. The vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework. For students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)"

      "Academic integrity in Computer Science modules For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable. Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work. Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting. Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements. UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities. Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree. Investigating and penalising academic misconduct Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted. In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct. Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

Teaching and learning Information on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.) Students on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments. Synchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable. Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons There is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.) Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual Personal study Information on personal study time (Local.) Activities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor. Attendance and engagement Information on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.) Attendance requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials. The Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25. Each Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the UCL Student Attendance Policy. Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.) Students should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent. Students encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.

    "reference_contexts": [
      "Introduction to the department and faculty An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both. Department of Computer Science and its history Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research. In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent. Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond. Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes. UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work. Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques. Though diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world."

The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\nFaculty Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\nElections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better. Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n[CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n\nAcademic Representatives | Students' Union UCL\n\nFind your representative | Students' Union UCL\n\nChapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual\n\nDepartmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year. Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement. SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative. Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study. Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n[CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n\nChapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual\n\nStudent voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\nStaff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n[Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\nSurveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\nStudent forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff. Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution. Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum. If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\nComputer Science Student Hub | Moodle\n\nStudents' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe Students' Union Advice Service is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme. Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL. The Advice Service specialises in: - Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework - UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries - Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes - Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts - Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential. No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission. Students can complete the online contact form for advice and support.\n\nStudent complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\nInformal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\nRoute of Escalation Academic Academic Pastoral Administrative Academic Representatives Module Lead Personal Tutor Teaching and Learning Team Year Co-ordinator Programme Director Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education\n\nContact details are available as follows: - Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the UCL Directory. - Programme Leaders via Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook. - Students' Union contacts are available via the Advice Service | Students' Union UCL.\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can. The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\nFormal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions. Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\nChapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual",

The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\nKey contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance.

      "<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\nDepartment of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\nKey staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out key role-holders within the department and faculty, i.e. those roles with over-arching responsibilities.\n\nDepartmental senior management\n\nRole Contact Head of Department Daniel Alexander Deputy Head of Department Yvonne Rogers Deputy Head of Department Anthony Steed Director of Education Dariush Hosseini Departmental Tutor Lewis Griffin Director of Research Simon Arridge\n\nFaculty senior management contacts\n\nRole Contact Executive Dean of Faculty Andy Nisbet Faculty Manager Sara Collins Faculty Director of Education & Student Experience Alice Smalley Faculty Vice Dean of Education Liz Jones\n\nDepartmental administrative contacts\n\nRole Contact Affiliate & Ancillary Tutor Shi Zhou Research Internships Tutor Shi Zhou Outreach Coordinator Elaine Pimentel Study Abroad Tutor Shi Zhou Year in Industry Tutor Shi Zhou Teaching Support Coordinator Sarah Sanders Athena SWAN Coordinator Graham Roberts Athena SWAN Coordinator Colin Malley Careers Tutor Tigmanshu Bhatnagar\n\nOther departmental contacts\n\nRole Contact Teaching & Learning Manager Jo Stiles Assessment Manager Martin Nolan Learning Technology Manager Samantha Bottomley Programmes, Systems & Data Manager David Howells Senior Teaching & Learning Administrator (PGT Programmes) Louisa Ball Senior Teaching & Learning Administrator (UG Programmes) Clair Parkin Departmental Safety Officer Mark Jackson Chair of the Departmental Education Committee Dariush Hosseini Secretary to the Departmental Education Committee Jo Stiles Chair of the Departmental Extenuating Circumstances Panel (PGT) Shi Zhou For EC specific queries, please contact the panel via cs.ec@ucl.ac.uk only.

I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience. This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary. UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost Head of Department's welcome Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science. Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world. It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country. One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you. So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being. I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year. Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department",
      "<2-hop>\n\nStudent feedback The role of student feedback The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results. Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. You Shape UCL | UCL Survey News and Results | UCL Student surveys Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. National Student Survey | Office for Students Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE Module dialogue Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students."

It emphasizes that students are partners in shaping education at UCL, encouraging them to take part in university-wide surveys and volunteer as academic representatives to work closely with their departments. Specific mechanisms for providing feedback include the student representative scheme, where elected representatives act as the student voice; active dialogue with module leaders via Moodle discussion forums; posting ideas or concerns on the departmental student voice platform; and attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or the Departmental Tutor. Additionally, UCL gathers feedback through online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations, and the New to UCL survey. Regular pulse surveys during modules allow students to reflect on their learning and provide constructive feedback, enabling teaching staff to make improvements before the module ends and for future cohorts.",

      "<2-hop>\n\nSubject Support Guides - Computer Science | UCL Library Services Moodle (virtual learning environment) Information on how to access Moodle and support contacts. Moodle is UCL's online learning space. It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments. All taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions. Assessment information on Moodle Each module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team (cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). Access to Moodle pages Students will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.  updating personal data such as addresses or contact numbers; - completing pre-enrolment and enrolment; - completing online module registration; - viewing information about programmes/ modules; - viewing confirmed module results and programme outcomes once they have been released by UCL Academic Services; - completing changes to registration status, including programme transfers, interruptions, and withdrawals; - submitting Extenuating Circumstances applications; - planning and recording skills development; and - applying for graduation ceremonies. It is essential that students keep their contact details up to date on Portico to ensure they receive important information from the university, including their final transcript and, if they are conferred an award, their degree certificate. What is Portico | UCL Student and Registry Services Portico Support | UCL Student and Registry Services Research Student Log (MRes only) Information on the Research Student Log, which applies for MRes students. To fulfil UCL’s commitment to the quality of its research programmes, the Doctoral School provides the Research Student Log for the use of all research students at UCL. The Log is a mandatory component of all UCL research degree programmes (including the MRes) and has been prepared to assist students throughout their degree programme at UCL. It provides a framework for recording details related to the student’s graduate research programme, scheduled supervisory meetings and activities concerning the development of academic and key skills. The Log will also help students to assess their progress and to plan and chart evidence of the development of academic and discipline-specific skills and key skills."

      "<1-hop>\n\nHours of study Information on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.) Teaching and learning Information on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.) Students on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments. Synchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable. Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons There is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.) Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual Personal study Information on personal study time (Local.) Activities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor. Attendance and engagement Information on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.) Attendance requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials. The Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25. Each Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the UCL Student Attendance Policy. Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.) Students should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent. Students encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.

He also emphasizes the department's unique focus on diversity, adopting a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist, combining fundamental theory with practical applications, and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts. Regarding assessments, the department carefully manages assessment dates to consider students' workloads. Assessments for Computer Science modules typically include coursework, tests, presentations, and examinations. Coursework submissions usually occur during the term in which the module is delivered plus two to three weeks. Examinations take place from 29 April to 30 May 2025, with additional late summer assessment periods and a January resit period for postgraduate taught programmes. Assessment deadlines may be set during Reading Weeks but not during closure periods, weekends, or UK bank holidays, ensuring a balanced workload for students.",

The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.\n\nThe Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students. It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL. All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students. The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students. Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.\n\nMake a change | Students' Union UCL\n\nStudent clubs & societies\n\nInformation on student societies.\n\nAt Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in.

One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\nCourse Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\nLead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\nFaculty Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\nElections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.

We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\nYou Shape UCL | UCL\n\nSurvey News and Results | UCL\n\nStudent surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\nNational Student Survey | Office for Students\n\nPostgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE\n\nModule dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\nUCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\nUCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL: - Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL. - Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff. - Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend. - There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\nStudent Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\nStudent Quality Reviewers, where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can: - Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel; - Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles; - Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme; - Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner; - Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work."

      "<2-hop>\n\nEmployability and careers Computer Science careers Information on careers resources within the department. Computer Science students have access to a careers tutor, who can provide guidance for accessing and making the most of careers resources at UCL. Computer Science Careers Tutor: Tigmanshu Bhatnagar UCL careers Information on UCL’s careers services for current students and recent graduates. UCL Careers provides a wide variety of careers information, one-to-one guidance and events for UCL students and recent graduates. UCL Careers assists them through the entire job hunting process, including exploring options, searching for vacancies, preparing CVs and applications, practicing for interviews, aptitude tests or assessment centres, and providing access to recruitment fairs and other employment-related events. They can also advise on exploring options for further study and funding. Services and events are available to all taught students, researchers (PhD students and postdocs) and graduates (for up to three years after course completion). UCL Careers also supports employability activities within departments such as work-related learning and internships. UCL students are helped with applications and sourcing opportunities with web resources and advice. They can book appointments and search for internship and graduate job vacancies via myUCLCareers. Optional internships and placements Information on optional internships that are not part of the programme. An internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation. Undergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme. Departmental research internships The department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams. Industrial placement year ('year in industry') Students who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree. Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations Student projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's Industry Exchange Network (IXN). Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings."

Specifically, students have access to a careers tutor within the department, Tigmanshu Bhatnagar, who offers guidance on making the most of UCL's careers resources. For practical experience, students can undertake optional internships during the summer between academic years, which are not part of the degree programme but provide valuable skills and experience. Additionally, the department offers paid research internships over the summer with research staff or teams. Students may also apply for a 'Year in Industry' to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner, which formally extends the degree by one year. Final year projects and dissertations may involve industrial collaboration through the Industry Exchange Network, sometimes requiring on-site engagement.

    "user_input": "How do the policies on summative assessments at UCL define the structure and feedback timelines for these assessments, and what specific provisions does the Computer Science department have regarding feedback and provisional marks?",
    "reference_contexts": [
      "<1-hop>\n\nAssessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\nAssessment\n\nOverview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\nAssessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n# Method (or type) Title Weight (%) 1 Coursework Coursework 1 15 2 Coursework Coursework 2 25 3 Open book examination Online remote examination 60\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAssessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\nDeliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\nIndividual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\nEngagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\nMarking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\nChapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual\n\nMarking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual\n\nFeedback\n\nFeedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\nUCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\nComputer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\nComputer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\nComputer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual\n\nExaminations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information.\n\nExamination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: - Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 - Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\nExamination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates. Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\nExams and assessments | UCL Students\n\nAssessment Success Guide | UCL Students\n\nChapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual\n\nIntercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the Academic Manual (see Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual).\n\nComputer Science past exam paper policy\n\nUCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\nCoursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\nCoursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: - Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) - Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\nCoursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\nSupport for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\nPenalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\nMitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\nUCL’s Student Support Framework\n\nLate penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\nExtent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline) Description of penalty to apply Notes Less than 2 working days late. Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late. Component mark capped at the module pass mark. Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) Component mark of 1.00%. Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided. Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners. Component mark of zero. Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.\n\nWork submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.\n\nApplication of late penalties\n\nLate penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual\n\nPenalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\nApplication of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAbsence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\nMitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\nChapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual\n\nCondonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might: 1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme); 2. be required to resit failed components of the module; 3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or 4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\nCondonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\nChapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual\n\nGuide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students\n\nGuide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students\n\n[Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\nReassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat: - Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period. - Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components. - Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\nChapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual\n\nDeferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\nIllness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students\n\nChapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAcademic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\nAcademic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with: - the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage. - the UCL Moodle course 'Introduction to Academic Integrity'. - examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website. - Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example: - referencing conventions; - opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others; - attribution of contributions in group work; and - any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\nAcademic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\nAcademic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\nInvestigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\nChapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual\n\nResearch ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\nUCL Research Ethics | UCL\n\nMarking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\nComputer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\nExternal examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk. On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services (examiners@ucl.ac.uk.)\n\nChapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual",
      "<2-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

    "reference": "At UCL, summative assessments are designed to evaluate students' achievement of a module's learning outcomes and contribute to their academic outcome. Each module has one or more summative components, each with a defined method, title, and weight, collectively known as the module's assessment pattern. Feedback on summative assessments is a key part of the learning process. UCL policy mandates that all students receive feedback within one calendar month of the submission deadline, which may include provisional marks, written feedback, discussions, or model answers. If delays occur, students are informed, and the extra time should not exceed one week. Specifically, the Computer Science department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends and holidays. Feedback may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research projects or dissertations, draft feedback is provided within 10 working days if the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline. The department monitors feedback return and notifies students of any delays via Moodle. Regarding provisional marks, Computer Science usually releases them alongside coursework feedback, but provisional marks are not released for examinations due to their proximity to final result publication. Final marks are confirmed and released via Student Registry Services after Board of Examiners approval.",

Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\nPersonal tutors | UCL Students\n\nTransition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential.

      "<2-hop>\n\nAcademic integrity in Computer Science modules For Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable. Students should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work. Finally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting. Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating Students work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements. UCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities. Students should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree. Investigating and penalising academic misconduct Examiners will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted. In addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct. Where academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.

    "reference": "Academic Coordinators have distinct responsibilities depending on the level of study. The Academic Coordinator for Taught Postgraduate Programmes oversees the delivery, review, and development of postgraduate programmes, including reviewing student feedback, leading programme reviews, rationalising modules, ensuring coordination between programmes, and supporting the Departmental Tutor with postgraduate matters. Academic Coordinators for Undergraduate Programmes manage teaching and learning within a designated year of study, acting as academic leads for teaching staff, ensuring quality and coherence of teaching, coordinating coursework deadlines to avoid clustering, providing timely information and advice to students, and managing tutorial activities. These roles are crucial in maintaining academic standards and supporting students throughout their studies. Regarding academic misconduct, the department has clear regulations defining misconduct, such as unauthorized use or sharing of code, and a zero-tolerance approach to contract cheating. Investigations into suspected misconduct involve examiners reviewing originality and integrity of submitted work, potentially using tools like Turnitin or Measure of Software Similarity, and may include oral examinations or panels. Penalties for confirmed misconduct can range up to exclusion from UCL or rescindment of qualifications. Academic Coordinators, by overseeing programme delivery and student experience, play a key role in ensuring students are informed about academic integrity policies and in supporting the enforcement of these procedures within their programmes.",

Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\nAcademic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\nGraduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\nUCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All UCL alumni can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups.

      "<2-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers.\n\nSupport for financial issues | UCL Students\n\nStudent of Concern\n\nThere are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.\n\nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.\n\nSupport for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students\n\nOther sources of support\n\nInformation about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services.\n\nRegistering with a doctor\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to register with a doctor as soon as possible after they arrive in London so that they can access healthcare quickly if they become ill or injured. When attending a university in the UK students under the age of 25 are also advised to be vaccinated against meningitis (ACWY).\n\nThe Ridgmount Practice is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus). Students can also choose to register with a practice closer to where they live if they prefer. The Ridgmount Practice also runs a walk-in surgery which any UCL student can attend, even if they are not registered with the practice.\n\nCounselling, support and information helpline\n\nAs part of a partnership with an organisation external to UCL, we provide an information and counselling helpline. The 24/7 Student Support Line is free of charge and includes access to information specialists who are trained by Citizens Advice and to professionally qualified and BACP accredited counsellors who can help students with a range of emotional and psychological difficulties.\n\nMental health and wellbeing crisis support (immediate and urgent help)\n\nIf a student needs urgent help themselves or are concerned that someone else does, they should reach out immediately to get the support required.\n\nEmergencies - immediate danger of harm\n\nIf anyone is in immediate danger, experiencing a mental health or wellbeing crisis and is in immediate risk of harming themselves or someone else then call the UK Emergency Services directly on 999 (or +44 (0)20 7230 1212 internationally) (or alternatively those who are deaf or hard of hearing can use the UK textphone service on 18000.) An ambulance will be able to bring the person in crisis directly to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) department of their local hospital to get urgent help. For students in the UK, University College Hospital (UCH) is the nearest A&E department to campus and has a dedicated mental health unit.\n\nUrgent support - students in distress\n\nIf a someone is feeling distressed, urgent medical support can be obtained by contacting: - The student’s GP surgery to request an emergency appointment. - The free NHS out-of-hours medical line on 111. - The Samaritans on 116 123 to talk to someone at any time, day or night. - The Nightline service on +44 (0) 207 631 0101 to talk to someone overnight during term time.\n\nFurther sources of support are available via the Crisis support | UCL Students pages.\n\nIf assisting someone in accessing crisis support and there are concerns for their wellbeing or safety, please complete the Student of Concern Form to inform Student Support and Wellbeing providing as much information as possible. The Student Support and Wellbeing Team will treat any such reports with sensitivity and will seek to provide appropriate support to the student concerned.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion support\n\nInformation on how students can access support/ information related to Equality and Diversity.\n\nThe Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Team aims to acknowledge, understand, and tackle structural inequities and unjust social power imbalances that affect our communities across the institution. This means recognising how we got here and what needs to be done to ensure equity, inclusion and belonging for those who are not systemically privileged by our society. UCL is a place where people can be authentic and their unique perspective, experiences and skills seen as a valuable asset to the institution.\n\nThe Equity, Diversity & Inclusion website brings together a range of information on issues relating to race, gender, religion and belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability amongst other equalities initiatives at UCL.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion at Computer Science\n\nAt UCL Computer Science, we are committed to supporting and promoting equity, diversity and inclusion. We believe in inspiring, empowering and engaging people from all backgrounds, cultures, identities and abilities and creating fair opportunities for all our students and staff members.\n\nThe department has established an EDI Committee, with staff and student members, which aims to develop a long-term EDI strategy, identify and propose long, medium and short-term priorities, and draw up action plans enhance EDI within our community.\n\nInclusion Leads also provide support and assistance for students and staff on issues relating to equalities and diversity.\n\nEquity, Diversity & Inclusion | UCL Computer Science\n\nUCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours\n\nInformation about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours.\n\nBullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse\n\nEvery student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to: - Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment. - Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal. - Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.\n\nStudents can request to speak to all the following advisors: - Dignity Advisor - Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor - Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff) - Student Casework Team - Independent Sexual Violence Advisors - Student Support and Wellbeing\n\nThe department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.\n\nSupport for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse\n\nUCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by sexual violence and/or domestic abuse. If a student would like to talk to somebody at UCL, the Student Support and Wellbeing Team can offer advice on the support available both internally and externally.",

In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum. Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual Marking scales Computer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment. Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark. Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module. Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual Feedback Feedback and provisional marks Regular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation. UCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice. Please check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information. Examination scheduling Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms. The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: - Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 - Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025 The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable. Examination conduct Students must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates. Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.

With such a diverse offering available there is bound to be something that sparks your interest! Clubs and societies are a great way to develop your skills and find a community at UCL. The Welcome Fair in early October is the perfect chance to meet them all in one place and learn more about what they have on offer!\n\nUCL Technology Society\n\nThe society most relevant to Computer Science is the Technology Society (TechSoc), which has a large number of members from the department. TechSoc puts on a full programme of events, from workshops to hackathons, tech talks by external speakers, and other social events.\n\nClubs and societies | Students' Union UCL\n\nWhat's on? | Students' Union UCL\n\nAcademic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)\n\nStudents' Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\nCourse Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\nLead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\nFaculty Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\nElections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better. Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n[CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n\nAcademic Representatives | Students' Union UCL\n\nFind your representative | Students' Union UCL\n\nChapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual\n\nDepartmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year. Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement. SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative. Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study. Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n[CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n\nChapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual\n\nStudent voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\nStaff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n[Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\nSurveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\nStudent forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff. Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution. Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum. If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\nComputer Science Student Hub | Moodle\n\nStudents' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe Students' Union Advice Service is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme. Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL. The Advice Service specialises in: - Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework - UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries - Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes - Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts - Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential. No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission. Students can complete the online contact form for advice and support.\n\nStudent complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\nInformal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\nRoute of Escalation Academic Academic Pastoral Administrative Academic Representatives Module Lead Personal Tutor Teaching and Learning Team Year Co-ordinator Programme Director Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education\n\nContact details are available as follows: - Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the UCL Directory. - Programme Leaders via Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook. - Students' Union contacts are available via the Advice Service | Students' Union UCL.\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can. The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\nFormal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions. Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\nChapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual",

It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\nTeaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\nAbout the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes.

Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\nPersonal tutors | UCL Students\n\nTransition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential.

      "<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\nDepartment of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\nKey staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out key role-holders within the department and faculty, i.e. those roles with over-arching responsibilities.\n\nDepartmental senior management\n\nRole Contact Head of Department Daniel Alexander Deputy Head of Department Yvonne Rogers Deputy Head of Department Anthony Steed Director of Education Dariush Hosseini Departmental Tutor Lewis Griffin Director of Research Simon Arridge\n\nFaculty senior management contacts\n\nRole Contact Executive Dean of Faculty Andy Nisbet Faculty Manager Sara Collins Faculty Director of Education & Student Experience Alice Smalley Faculty Vice Dean of Education Liz Jones\n\nDepartmental administrative contacts\n\nRole Contact Affiliate & Ancillary Tutor Shi Zhou Research Internships Tutor Shi Zhou Outreach Coordinator Elaine Pimentel Study Abroad Tutor Shi Zhou Year in Industry Tutor Shi Zhou Teaching Support Coordinator Sarah Sanders Athena SWAN Coordinator Graham Roberts Athena SWAN Coordinator Colin Malley Careers Tutor Tigmanshu Bhatnagar\n\nOther departmental contacts\n\nRole Contact Teaching & Learning Manager Jo Stiles Assessment Manager Martin Nolan Learning Technology Manager Samantha Bottomley Programmes, Systems & Data Manager David Howells Senior Teaching & Learning Administrator (PGT Programmes) Louisa Ball Senior Teaching & Learning Administrator (UG Programmes) Clair Parkin Departmental Safety Officer Mark Jackson Chair of the Departmental Education Committee Dariush Hosseini Secretary to the Departmental Education Committee Jo Stiles Chair of the Departmental Extenuating Circumstances Panel (PGT) Shi Zhou For EC specific queries, please contact the panel via cs.ec@ucl.ac.uk only.

The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.\n\nThe Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students. It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL. All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students. The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students. Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.\n\nMake a change | Students' Union UCL\n\nStudent clubs & societies\n\nInformation on student societies.\n\nAt Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in. Maybe you are interested in sports with our TeamUCL clubs or low commitment exercise with our Project Active scheme? Perhaps you are keen to perform on-stage in the Bloomsbury Theatre or you want to learn about and celebrate different cultures? With such a diverse offering available there is bound to be something that sparks your interest! Clubs and societies are a great way to develop your skills and find a community at UCL. The Welcome Fair in early October is the perfect chance to meet them all in one place and learn more about what they have on offer!\n\nUCL Technology Society\n\nThe society most relevant to Computer Science is the Technology Society (TechSoc), which has a large number of members from the department. TechSoc puts on a full programme of events, from workshops to hackathons, tech talks by external speakers, and other social events.\n\nClubs and societies | Students' Union UCL\n\nWhat's on? | Students' Union UCL\n\nAcademic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)\n\nStudents' Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL. One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice. They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve. They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\nCourse Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them. The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\nLead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes. The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\nFaculty Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\nElections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October. If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.

Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n[Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\nSurveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term. These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\nStudent forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff. Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution. Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum. If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\nComputer Science Student Hub | Moodle\n\nStudents' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe Students' Union Advice Service is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme. Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL. The Advice Service specialises in: - Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework - UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries - Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes - Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts - Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential. No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission. Students can complete the online contact form for advice and support.\n\nStudent complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL. However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\nInformal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service. UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\nRoute of Escalation Academic Academic Pastoral Administrative Academic Representatives Module Lead Personal Tutor Teaching and Learning Team Year Co-ordinator Programme Director Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education Departmental Tutor or Director of Education\n\nContact details are available as follows: - Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the UCL Directory. - Programme Leaders via Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook. - Students' Union contacts are available via the Advice Service | Students' Union UCL.\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can. The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\nFormal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation. The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.

      "<1-hop>\n\nIntroduction to the department and faculty An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both. Department of Computer Science and its history Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research. In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent. Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond. Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes. UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work. Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques. Though diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.",

The department works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences to foster interdisciplinary research and teaching. Regarding departmental senior management, the Head of Department is Daniel Alexander, with Yvonne Rogers and Anthony Steed serving as Deputy Heads. Dariush Hosseini is the Director of Education, Lewis Griffin is the Departmental Tutor, and Simon Arridge is the Director of Research.",

    "reference_contexts": [
      "<1-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\nPersonal tutors | UCL Students\n\nTransition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\nTransition Mentors | UCL Students\n\nProgramming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff."

      "<2-hop>\n\nStudent feedback The role of student feedback The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results. Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. You Shape UCL | UCL Survey News and Results | UCL Student surveys Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. National Student Survey | Office for Students Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE Module dialogue Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students."

    "reference_contexts": [
      "<1-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

    "reference_contexts": [
      "<1-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual Examinations Information on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website. An examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.

All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action. Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual Module information Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study. Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students.

Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time.

Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\nPersonal tutors | UCL Students\n\nTransition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\nTransition Mentors | UCL Students\n\nProgramming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff."

Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. You Shape UCL | UCL Survey News and Results | UCL Student surveys Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. National Student Survey | Office for Students Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE Module dialogue Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students."

However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided. Before raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them. Whilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance. Informal resolution Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.

      "<1-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur.

      "<1-hop>\n\nStudent feedback The role of student feedback The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results. Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. You Shape UCL | UCL Survey News and Results | UCL Student surveys Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. National Student Survey | Office for Students Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE Module dialogue Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.",
