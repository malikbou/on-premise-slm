      "Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\nModules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\nModule availability\n\nModules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\nModules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\nComputer Science | Study Abroad at UCL\n\nModule registration for affiliates | UCL Students\n\nModule selection\n\nChoosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment.\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\nModule selection | UCL Students\n\nApproval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\nChange of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\nVerification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\nChoosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\nPortico | UCL\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nContinuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students\n\nAvailability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nSection 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual\n\nModule information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\nModule catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.\n\nThe UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\nModule deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\nModule timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\nKey contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\nAcademic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\nAcademic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\nAdministrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator."

Places on compulsory modules are guaranteed, but optional and elective modules have limited places allocated by priority and availability. If a module is full or you do not meet prerequisites, your selection may be rejected and you will need to choose an alternative.",

Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\nAcademic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\nGraduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\nUCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All UCL alumni can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\nServices for Alumni | UCL\n\nAlumni of the department | UCL Computer Science"

They help international students settle into life in the UK and make the most of their time at UCL and in London. This includes practical guidance on healthcare, banking, transport and safety, as well as information about the International Student Orientation Programme (ISOP).\n\nInternational Students | UCL Students\n\nStudy Abroad Support\n\nThe Study Abroad team provide administrative and welfare support to all undergraduate students undertaking a period abroad as part of their studies, working with colleagues, including Study Abroad Tutors, across academic departments in order to advise and guide students from application through to their return to studies at UCL. The team coordinates a diverse portfolio of global student opportunities via different projects: Student Exchanges and Exchange Agreements, the Turing Scheme, Global Experience (Summer Schools, volunteering abroad, short-term mobility).\n\nGo Abroad | UCL Students\n\nAccommodation\n\nUCL Accommodation provides a range of housing options which includes two Halls of Residence (catered), self-catered Student Houses and Intercollegiate Halls (both catered and self-catered) shared with other colleges of the University of London. Each Hall has a designated Warden supported by a number of live-in Student Residence Advisers (SRA) to provide support for students and to foster a positive environment within the accommodation.\n\nAccommodation | UCL Students\n\nFinancial support\n\nThe UCL Student Funding Office provides a central service aimed at supporting students with money matters. We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers.\n\nSupport for financial issues | UCL Students\n\nStudent of Concern\n\nThere are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.\n\nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe.\n\nSupport for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students\n\nOther sources of support\n\nInformation about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services.\n\nRegistering with a doctor\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to register with a doctor as soon as possible after they arrive in London so that they can access healthcare quickly if they become ill or injured. When attending a university in the UK students under the age of 25 are also advised to be vaccinated against meningitis (ACWY).\n\nThe Ridgmount Practice is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus). Students can also choose to register with a practice closer to where they live if they prefer. The Ridgmount Practice also runs a walk-in surgery which any UCL student can attend, even if they are not registered with the practice.\n\nCounselling, support and information helpline\n\nAs part of a partnership with an organisation external to UCL, we provide an information and counselling helpline. The 24/7 Student Support Line is free of charge and includes access to information specialists who are trained by Citizens Advice and to professionally qualified and BACP accredited counsellors who can help students with a range of emotional and psychological difficulties.\n\nMental health and wellbeing crisis support (immediate and urgent help)\n\nIf a student needs urgent help themselves or are concerned that someone else does, they should reach out immediately to get the support required.\n\nEmergencies - immediate danger of harm\n\nIf anyone is in immediate danger, experiencing a mental health or wellbeing crisis and is in immediate risk of harming themselves or someone else then call the UK Emergency Services directly on 999 (or +44 (0)20 7230 1212 internationally) (or alternatively those who are deaf or hard of hearing can use the UK textphone service on 18000.) An ambulance will be able to bring the person in crisis directly to the Accident & Emergency (A&E) department of their local hospital to get urgent help. For students in the UK, University College Hospital (UCH) is the nearest A&E department to campus and has a dedicated mental health unit.\n\nUrgent support - students in distress\n\nIf a someone is feeling distressed, urgent medical support can be obtained by contacting: - The student’s GP surgery to request an emergency appointment. - The free NHS out-of-hours medical line on 111. - The Samaritans on 116 123 to talk to someone at any time, day or night. - The Nightline service on +44 (0) 207 631 0101 to talk to someone overnight during term time.\n\nFurther sources of support are available via the Crisis support | UCL Students pages.\n\nIf assisting someone in accessing crisis support and there are concerns for their wellbeing or safety, please complete the Student of Concern Form to inform Student Support and Wellbeing providing as much information as possible. The Student Support and Wellbeing Team will treat any such reports with sensitivity and will seek to provide appropriate support to the student concerned.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion support\n\nInformation on how students can access support/ information related to Equality and Diversity.\n\nThe Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Team aims to acknowledge, understand, and tackle structural inequities and unjust social power imbalances that affect our communities across the institution. This means recognising how we got here and what needs to be done to ensure equity, inclusion and belonging for those who are not systemically privileged by our society. UCL is a place where people can be authentic and their unique perspective, experiences and skills seen as a valuable asset to the institution.\n\nThe Equity, Diversity & Inclusion website brings together a range of information on issues relating to race, gender, religion and belief, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability amongst other equalities initiatives at UCL.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion at Computer Science\n\nAt UCL Computer Science, we are committed to supporting and promoting equity, diversity and inclusion. We believe in inspiring, empowering and engaging people from all backgrounds, cultures, identities and abilities and creating fair opportunities for all our students and staff members.\n\nThe department has established an EDI Committee, with staff and student members, which aims to develop a long-term EDI strategy, identify and propose long, medium and short-term priorities, and draw up action plans enhance EDI within our community.\n\nInclusion Leads also provide support and assistance for students and staff on issues relating to equalities and diversity.\n\nEquity, Diversity & Inclusion | UCL Computer Science\n\nUCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours\n\nInformation about UCL’s approach to preventing and responding to harmful behaviours.\n\nBullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse\n\nEvery student and member of staff has a right to work and study without experiencing harm. Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has Report and Support, an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to: - Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment. - Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal. - Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.\n\nStudents can request to speak to all the following advisors: - Dignity Advisor - Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor - Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff) - Student Casework Team - Independent Sexual Violence Advisors - Student Support and Wellbeing\n\nThe department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.\n\nSupport for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse\n\nUCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by sexual violence and/or domestic abuse. If a student would like to talk to somebody at UCL, the Student Support and Wellbeing Team can offer advice on the support available both internally and externally."

      "Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\nAssessment\n\nOverview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\nAssessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n# Method (or type) Title Weight (%) 1 Coursework Coursework 1 15 2 Coursework Coursework 2 25 3 Open book examination Online remote examination 60\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAssessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\nDeliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\nIndividual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\nEngagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\nMarking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\nChapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual\n\nMarking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual\n\nFeedback\n\nFeedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\nUCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\nComputer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\nComputer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\nComputer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual\n\nExaminations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information.\n\nExamination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: - Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 - Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\nExamination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates. Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\nExams and assessments | UCL Students\n\nAssessment Success Guide | UCL Students\n\nChapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual\n\nIntercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the Academic Manual (see Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual).\n\nComputer Science past exam paper policy\n\nUCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\nCoursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\nCoursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: - Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) - Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\nCoursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\nSupport for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\nPenalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\nMitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\nUCL’s Student Support Framework\n\nLate penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\nExtent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline) Description of penalty to apply Notes Less than 2 working days late. Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late. Component mark capped at the module pass mark. Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) Component mark of 1.00%. Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided. Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners. Component mark of zero. Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.\n\nWork submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.\n\nApplication of late penalties\n\nLate penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual\n\nPenalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\nApplication of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\nChapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAbsence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\nMitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\nChapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual\n\nCondonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might: 1. be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme); 2. be required to resit failed components of the module; 3. be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or 4. apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\nCondonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\nChapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual\n\nGuide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students\n\nGuide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students\n\n[Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\nReassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat: - Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period. - Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components. - Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\nChapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual\n\nDeferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\nIllness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students\n\nChapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual\n\nAcademic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\nAcademic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with: - the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage. - the UCL Moodle course 'Introduction to Academic Integrity'. - examination conduct requirements, as set out in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates, which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website. - Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example: - referencing conventions; - opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others; - attribution of contributions in group work; and - any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\nAcademic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\nAcademic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\nInvestigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\nChapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual\n\nChapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual\n\nResearch ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\nUCL Research Ethics | UCL\n\nMarking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\nComputer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\nExternal examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk. On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services (examiners@ucl.ac.uk.)\n\nChapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual"

An assessment task may require multiple deliverables, all sharing the same deadline, with submission considered complete when all deliverables are submitted. Task instructions specify collaboration parameters and peer assessment details if applicable. Deadlines for coursework are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section, typically with a 4:00pm UK time deadline unless otherwise stated. Coursework scheduling is managed by the teaching department, with Computer Science coursework usually occurring in specified weeks of each term.

      "Module information & selection Advice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection. Modules Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.) Compulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests. Module availability Modules for Computer Science students The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages.

Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students Module selection Choosing modules for 2024-25 Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment. Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible. Module selection | UCL Students Approval of selections Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process. Change of selections Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader. Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico. Verification of selections Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.) Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students) Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer. Portico | UCL Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students Availability and allocation of places Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints. Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective. Within those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module. All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action. Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual Module information Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study. Notably, a delivery with the code 'U'"

    "reference": "Optional modules are modules that may be taken in addition to compulsory core modules and usually relate closely to the programme's core discipline, allowing students to specialise in complementary subject areas. Places on optional modules are not guaranteed and are allocated after compulsory module places have been assigned. Allocation priority is given first to students for whom the module is compulsory, then to those for whom it is optional, and finally to those for whom it is elective. Within these groups, Computer Science students have priority over non-Computer Science students, and places are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. If an optional module has no remaining capacity, is not formally available to the student, or prerequisites are not met, the selection will be rejected, and the student must choose an alternative.

Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme. Module timetable Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study. Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other. Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week. Key contacts for module selection Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise. Academic advice on module selection For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor. Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department. Academic advice on specific modules For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue. Administrative advice and troubleshooting If a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator."
