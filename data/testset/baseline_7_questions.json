It\u2019s one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not. The Service runs three main programmes: Partnerships - linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners. Student-led Projects - supporting students to set up and run their own community projects. Community Research Initiative - connecting master\u2019s students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations. Through community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world.
