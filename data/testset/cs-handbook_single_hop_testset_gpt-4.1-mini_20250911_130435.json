Introduction and welcome\n\nWelcome messages from UCL's President and Provost and the Computer Science Head of Department, information about the scope and purpose of the Student Handbook, and general advice about changes to information through the year.\n\n### 1.1 Provost's welcome\n\nDear students,\n\nA warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back.\n\nYour UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future.\n\nWe want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL's research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges.\n\nI warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better.  Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience.\n\nThis is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.\n\nUCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.\n\nDr Michael Spence\n\nUCL President and Provost\n\n### 1.2 Head of Department's welcome\n\nWelcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science.\n\nOur discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\n### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n### 1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.\n\n---\n## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\n### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\n### 2.3 Key staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out

Hours of study\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)\n\n### 5.1 Teaching and learning\n\nInformation on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)\n\nStudents on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.\n\nSynchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.\n\n#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons\n\nThere is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)\n\n- [Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence#3.6)\n\n### 5.2 Personal study\n\nInformation on personal study time (Local.)\n\nActivities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.\n\n### 5.3 Attendance and engagement\n\nInformation on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)\n\n#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements\n\nUCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.\n\nThe Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.\n\nEach Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)\n\nStudents should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.\n\nStudents encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.\n\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n- [UCL Student Attendance Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy)\n- [Attendance at UCL | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/attendance-ucl)\n\n#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities\n\nIn line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.\n\n- [Immigration and visas | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas)\n- [Student visa responsibilities | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/student-visa-responsibilities)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n\n#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment\n\nIf a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under the [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).\n\n- [Extenuating Circumstances and Reasonable Adjustments | CS Student Handbook](\n\n---\n## 6.

It includes:\n- Where to find help and advice\n- Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student)\n- Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data\n- Information on providing supporting evidence\n- Links to other support options that are available to students.\n\n#### 7.1.2 Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works:\n\n| Support process                                                    | Use this if                                                                                                                                                   | What this covers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Delayed Assessment Scheme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Delayed-Assessment-Scheme)                                                 | You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC's.  | Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. |\n| [Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Extenuating-Circumstances)           | You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence.                                               | 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. |\n| [Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework#Reasonable-Adjustments) | You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition.                                                                                       | UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment.

Students take the first module of their chosen Minor in Year 2 and the second and third modules of that Minor in Year 3. Students cannot change their Minor once commenced in Year 2.\n\n- [How we teach | UCL Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/integrated-engineering-programme-iep/how-we-teach)\n- [IEP Central (24/25) | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25381)\n\n#### 8.3.2 Integrated Study Abroad Year\n\nInformation on Integrated Study Abroad Year options for eligible MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Study Abroad Year, the academic requirements for taking a Year Abroad, and how to apply.\n\nAn Integrated Study Abroad Year is one undertaken at an approved international partner institution in Year 3 of a 4-Year MEng programme. Students follow the Year 3 curriculum of the partner institution (instead of the Year 3 UCL curriculum) and then resume the standard MEng curriculum when they return to UCL in Year 4.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Integrated Study Abroad Year\n\nThe structure of programmes including a Study Abroad Year is as follows:\n\n| BSc    | MEng          | MEng (with Integrated Study Abroad Year) |\n| :----- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1        | Year 1                                   |\n| Year 2 | Year 2        | Year 2                                   |\n| Year 3 | Year 3        | Year 3 (Study Abroad)                    |\n|        | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 4 (MEng)                            |\n\nStudents in Year 2 of MEng Computer Science and MEng Mathematical Computation may apply for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students in Year 2 of BSc Computer Science students must transfer to the MEng Computer Science programme in parallel to making an application for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students who are approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year will transfer to the corresponding MEng (International Programme), which includes the Study Abroad Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Go abroad website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/go-abroad/) to learn more about the ethos of the programme and whether it may be right for them. Those who may be interested in applying a Study Abroad Year should then seek advice from the Study Abroad Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.3 Additional Placement Year\n\nInformation about taking an Additional Placement Year for eligible BSc and MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Year in Industry, the academic requirements for taking a Year in Industry, and how to apply.\n\nAn Additional Placement Year is one undertaken working in industry between the penultimate and final year of a BSc or MEng programme. Students resume the standard curriculum when they return to UCL in the next year; this extends the length of the degree by one year.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Additional Placement Year\n\n| BSc    | BSc (Placement in between Years 2 and 3) | MEng          | MEng (Placement between Years 2 and 3) | MEng (Placement between Years 3 and 4) |\n| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1                                   | Year 1        | Year 1                                 | Year 1                                 |\n| Year 2 | Year 2                                   | Year 2        | Year 2                                 | Year 2                                 |\n| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year                | Year 3        | Additional Placement Year              | Year 3                                 |\n|        | Year 3                                   | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3                                 | Additional Placement Year              |\n|        |                                          |               | Year 4 (MEng)                          | Year 4 (MEng)                          |\n\nStudents who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application (2)\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Research-based education website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/research-based-education) to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects\n\nInformation about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.\n\nStudents will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the [UCL Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.\n\n### 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification\n\nMany UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally-recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.\n\n### 8.5 Module details\n\nProgrammes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n- [Section 10.1: Modules | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 7, Section 3: Framework Components | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-7-programme-and-module-design-and-approval-framework/section-3-framework-components)\n\n## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring\n\nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)\n\n### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring\n\nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.\n\n#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring\n\n##### Support via Personal Tutoring\n\nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.\n\nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\n- [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)\n\n### 9.2 Transition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\n- [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)\n\n### 9.3 Programming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.\n\n---\n## 10. Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\n### 10.1 Modules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\n### 10.2 Module availability\n\n#### Modules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\n#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\n- [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospectus/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/affiliate-module-registration)\n\n### 10.3 Module selection\n\n#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-new-students/pre-enrolment). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-continuing-students/re-enrolment).\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\n- [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection)\n\n##### Approval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\n##### Change of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\n##### Verification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\n#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/continuing-student-module-registration)\n\n#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:\n- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)\n- Students for whom the module is optional.\n- Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection#2.8)\n\n### 10.4 Module information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\n#### Module catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have [published module introduction videos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/module-introductions) to help inform module selection.\n\nThe [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\n#### Module deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\n#### Module timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\n### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\n#### Academic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\n#### Academic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\n#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.\n\n---\n## 11. Changes to registration status\n\nInformation on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.\n\n### 11.1 Changing registration status\n\nStudents wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies)\n- [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.2 Changing programme\n\nStudents wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.\n\nStudents must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Study Abroad and Placement Years\n\nStudents who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.3 Interruption of studies\n\nStudents needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.\n\nStudents who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nNote: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.\n\n- [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme\n\nStudents wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.\n\nStudents who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-withdrawing-programme)\n\n### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status\n\nIf a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\n### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.\n\n---\n## 12. Progression, award, and classification\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n### 12.1 Progression and award requirements\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.\n\nA programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.\n\n| Degree                                     | Progression and Award Regulations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |\n| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure.

At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.\n2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.\n\nThese thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.\n\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award)\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n\n### 12.2 Classification requirements\n\nInformation on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.\n\nIf a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).\n\nIf a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their programme regulations are available.

Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\n### 13.1 Assessment\n\n#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\n#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |\n| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |\n| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |\n| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)\n\n#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\n##### Deliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\n##### Individual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\n##### Engagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\n##### Learning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n##### Marking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)\n\n#### 13.1.4 Marking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)\n\n### 13.2 Feedback\n\n#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\n##### UCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\n##### Computer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\n##### Computer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\n##### Computer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)\n\n### 13.3 Examinations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### Examination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:\n- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025\n- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\n#### Examination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\n- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)\n- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n#### Intercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).\n\n#### Computer Science past exam paper policy\n\n[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\n### 13.4 Coursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\n#### Coursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:\n- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)\n- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\n#### Coursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\n#### Support for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\n### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\n#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\n- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)\n\n#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\n| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |\n| 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late.                                                                                                                                              | Component mark capped at the module pass mark.                                     |                                                                                                                    |\n| Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) | Component mark of 1.00%.                                                           | Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                    |\n| Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners.                                                                       | Component mark of zero.                                                            | Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                          |\n\nWork submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.\n\n#### Application of late penalties\n\nLate penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\n#### Application of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)\n\n### 13.7 Absence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\n#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:\n1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);\n2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;\n3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or\n4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\n#### Condonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)\n- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)\n- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:\n- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.\n- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.\n- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)\n\n#### Deferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\n- [Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/extenuating-circumstances)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-deferred-assessment)\n\n### 13.9 Academic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\n#### Academic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with:\n- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).\n- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.\n- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.\n- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:\n- referencing conventions;\n- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;\n- attribution of contributions in group work; and\n- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\n#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:\n- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)\n- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)\n- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\n#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\n#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n### 13.10 Research ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\n- [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/integrity/ucl-research-ethics)\n\n### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\n#### Computer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\n### 13.12 External examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Chapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-4-external-examining)\n\n---\n## 14.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.\n\nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.\n\n#### Assessment information on Moodle\n\nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)).\n\n#### Access to Moodle pages\n\nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.\n\n- [Moodle Resource Centre | UCL Wiki](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/MoodleResourceCentre)\n\n### 14.4 Portico\n\nInformation on Portico – what it is, why it is important and who to contact for support.\n\n[Portico](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/portico/) is the main UCL student information system which is used by both staff and students.

Bullying, harassment, sexual misconduct and/or domestic abuse of one member of our community by another or others is never ok. UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has [Report and Support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/report-support/), an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:\n- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment.\n- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.\n- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.\n\nStudents can request to speak to all the following advisors:\n- Dignity Advisor\n- Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor\n- Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff)\n- Student Casework Team\n- Independent Sexual Violence Advisors\n- Student Support and Wellbeing\n\nThe department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.\n\n#### 15.4.2 Support for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse\n\nUCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by [sexual violence and/or domestic abuse](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/sexual-misconduct-and-violence).

They can book appointments and search for internship and graduate job vacancies via [myUCLCareers](https://ucl.targetconnect.net/).\n\n### 16.3 Optional internships and placements\n\nInformation on optional internships that are not part of the programme.\n\nAn internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.\n\nUndergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.\n\n#### Departmental research internships\n\nThe department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.\n\n#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')\n\nStudents who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.\n\n#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations\n\nStudent projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.\n\n### 16.4 Entrepreneurship at UCL\n\nInformation on entrepreneurship and enterprise at UCL.\n\nUCL has a long and successful track record of supporting spin-outs and start-ups developed by its academic and student communities.

[UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/) offers a wide range of support to students ranging from training programmes, advice on whether an idea has commercial potential, one-to-one sessions with business advisers, funding, competitions and incubator space to help them start or grow their business.\n\n## 17. Student representation and voice\n\n### 17.1 Students' Union UCL\n\nInformation on UCL Students' Union, how to run for election and how to find a student representative.\n\n[Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/) helps you to do more at UCL, experience something you've always dreamt of, turn a curiosity into a new passion and help you reach your potential.  The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.\n\nThe Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students.  It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL.  All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students.  The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students.  Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.\n\n- [Make a change | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change)\n\n### 17.2 Student clubs & societies\n\nInformation on student societies.\n\nAt Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in.

One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\n#### Course Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\n#### Lead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\n#### Faculty  Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\n#### Elections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Academic Representatives | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/academic-representatives)\n- [Find your representative | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation)\n\n### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation#6.4)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-7-student-representation-ucl-academic-standing)\n\n### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\n#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.3 Student forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\n- [Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25380)\n\n### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:\n- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework\n- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries\n- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes\n- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts\n- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.

However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\n#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\n| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |\n|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |\n|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |\n\nContact details are available as follows:\n- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).\n- Programme Leaders via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook](\n- Departmental Tutor and Faculty Tutor via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty | CS Student Handbook](\n- Course Representatives via in the [Directory of Academic Reps | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative).\n- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-8-student-complaints-procedure)\n- [Chapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-7-academic-appeals-procedure)\n\n---\n## 18. Student feedback\n\n### 18.1 The role of student feedback\n\nThe importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.\n\nOur goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:\n- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](\n- The student membership on UCL's committees.\n- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.\n- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.\n- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.\n- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\n- [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)\n- [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-feedback/survey-news-and-results)\n\n### 18.2 Student surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\n- [National Student Survey | Office for Students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/national-student-survey-nss/)\n- [Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/surveys/postgraduate-taught-experience-survey-ptes)\n\n### 18.3 Module dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\n### 18.4 UCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\n[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:\n- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.\n- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.\n- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.\n- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\n### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\n[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:\n- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;\n- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;\n- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;\n- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;\n- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.\n\n---\n## 19.

It's one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.\n\nThe Service runs three main programmes:\n- Partnerships linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners.\n- Student-led Projects supporting students to set up and run their own community projects.\n- Community Research Initiative connecting master's students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations.\n\nThrough community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world.  UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their academic study and well-being.\n\nThe Volunteering Service's opportunities can be found on its [online directory](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering-directory), where students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by cause.  There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around their studies and other commitments.\n\n## 21. Data protection and intellectual property\n\nInformation on how UCL uses student information, for what purposes, and the steps taken to safeguard this information; where to find information security, intellectual property and email policies; Information on how to enquire or make a related complaint. Where to find information security, intellectual property, and email policies.\n\n### 21.1 Data protection (how UCL uses student information)\n\nUCL uses student information for a range of purposes, including the provision of teaching and learning, managing accommodation and ensuring health and safety. Further information about how UCL uses student information can be found in the [UCL General Student Privacy Notice](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/general-student-privacy-notice).\n\nStudents may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Information Security Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/information-security-policy)\n- [Email Usage Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/email-usage-policy)\n- [Data Protection Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/data-protection-policy)\n- [Understand your intellectual property (IP) rights | UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/students/support-students-and-alumni/ip-intellectual-property)\n- [Report a Breach of Personal Data | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/report-breach-personal-data)\n\n### 21.2 Storing and securing data\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the [Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg), for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.\n\nIf students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The [UCL Dropbox service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/dropbox-ucl) may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.\n\nIf students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.\n\n- [Information Security | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/)\n- [File storage & sharing | UCL Information Services Division](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing)\n- [Encryption | UCL Information Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/abcs-information-security/e-encryption)\n\n---\n## 22. Health, safety, and security\n\nInformation on UCL's health, safety and security policies and procedures.\n\n### 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL\n\nUCL's overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL's activities are managed and conducted.\n\nThere are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment:\n- [UCL Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl), who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;\n- [UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/), who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples;\n- [UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/) who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.\n\n- [Accidents and Emergencies | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies)\n- [Emergency contacts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/emergency-contacts)\n- [Staying safe | UCL Students - UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe)\n- [Fire Safety at UCL | UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/fire-safety)\n- [Safety on and off campus | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/safety-and-campus)\n- [SafeZone App | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/safezone-app)\n\n### 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science\n\nThe policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.\n\nThe department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.\n\n### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department\n\nStudents should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.\n\n---\n## 23. After study\n\nInformation on confirmation of student status, transcripts and certificates, Higher Education Achievement Reports, academic references, and on UCL Alumni activities.\n\n### 23.1 Summary of options for confirmation of student status and award\n\nStudents and graduates may request evidence of their student status and academic record from UCL, including official statements, transcripts of results, and academic references. The [certificates and results pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates) set out detailed guidance on the types of documentation available, how to request these, and any restrictions that apply. The table below is intended to summarise that information; best efforts have been made to ensure it is correct.\n\n| Document (and link to more information) | Descriptor | Medium | How to acquire/ request | Eligibility | Notes |\n| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Statement of student status | An official letter that can used as proof of enrolment at UCL.

The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)\n\n- [Confirmation of registration and award | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates)\n- [Students and council tax | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money/managing-your-money/council-tax)\n- [Money and finances | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money)\n\n### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)\n\nInformation on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.\n\n#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results\n\nA [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.\n\n##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)\n\nStudents may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.\n\n##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n##### Affiliate students\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.\n\nUCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).\n\n#### 23.4.2 Degree certificates\n\nA [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.\n\nGraduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)\n\n#### 23.4.3 Statements of award\n\nA statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)\n\n### 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)\n\nInformation about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)\n\nA [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.\n\nNew students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).\n\nEach summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\n### 23.6 Academic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\n### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:\n- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;\n- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\n### 23.8 UCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\n- [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services-alumni)\n- [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/alumni)\n\n---\n## 24. Keeping in touch\n\nDetails of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.\n\n### 24.1 Central and Faculty communication channels\n\nWe will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:\n\n| Channel           | Descriptor                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly.          |\n| Moodle            | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |\n| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |\n| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |\n| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n### 24.2 Computer Science communications\n\n#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams\n\nStudents will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.\n\nStudents should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.\n\n##### Mailing lists\n\nStudents will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.\n\n##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels\n\nConnected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.\n\n##### Access and technical support\n\nAccess to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.\n\n#### 24.2.2 Social media\n\nComputer Science is active on the following social media channels:\n- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.\n- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.\n- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)\n- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)\n\n##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions\n\nThe Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.\n\n##### Schedule\n\n- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)\n- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)\n\nYou can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below.

It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\n### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n### 1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.\n\n---\n## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\n### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\n### 2.3 Key staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out key role-holders within the department and faculty, i.e. those roles with over-arching responsibilities.\n\n#### Departmental senior management\n\n| Role                        | Contact

Hours of study\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)\n\n### 5.1 Teaching and learning\n\nInformation on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)\n\nStudents on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.\n\nSynchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.\n\n#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons\n\nThere is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)\n\n- [Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence#3.6)\n\n### 5.2 Personal study\n\nInformation on personal study time (Local.)\n\nActivities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.\n\n### 5.3 Attendance and engagement\n\nInformation on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)\n\n#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements\n\nUCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.\n\nThe Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.\n\nEach Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)\n\nStudents should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.\n\nStudents encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.\n\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n- [UCL Student Attendance Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy)\n- [Attendance at UCL | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/attendance-ucl)\n\n#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities\n\nIn line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.\n\n- [Immigration and visas | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas)\n- [Student visa responsibilities | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/student-visa-responsibilities)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n\n#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment\n\nIf a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under the [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).\n\n- [Extenuating Circumstances and Reasonable Adjustments | CS Student Handbook](\n\n---\n## 6. Our expectations of students\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations of students, including student conduct and engagement with their programme of study.\n\n### 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct\n\nUCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with UCL's Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL's Student Disciplinary Procedures.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [UCL Disciplinary Code and Procedure in Respect of Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-11-student-disciplinary-code-and-procedure)\n- [UCL Prevention of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-1-student-related-policy/prevention-bullying-harassment-and-sexual-misconduct-policy)\n- [UCL Code of Practice on Freedom of Speech | UCL Student and Registry Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/governance-and-committees/governance/freedom-speech)\n- [Religion and Belief Equality Policy for Students | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/religion-and-belief/religion-and-belief-equality-policy-students)\n\n---\n## 7.

Students resume the standard curriculum when they return to UCL in the next year; this extends the length of the degree by one year.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Additional Placement Year\n\n| BSc    | BSc (Placement in between Years 2 and 3) | MEng          | MEng (Placement between Years 2 and 3) | MEng (Placement between Years 3 and 4) |\n| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1                                   | Year 1        | Year 1                                 | Year 1                                 |\n| Year 2 | Year 2                                   | Year 2        | Year 2                                 | Year 2                                 |\n| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year                | Year 3        | Additional Placement Year              | Year 3                                 |\n|        | Year 3                                   | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3                                 | Additional Placement Year              |\n|        |                                          |               | Year 4 (MEng)                          | Year 4 (MEng)                          |\n\nStudents who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application (2)\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Research-based education website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/research-based-education) to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects\n\nInformation about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.\n\nStudents will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the [UCL Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.\n\n### 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification\n\nMany UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally-recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.\n\n### 8.5 Module details\n\nProgrammes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n- [Section 10.1: Modules | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 7, Section 3: Framework Components | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-7-programme-and-module-design-and-approval-framework/section-3-framework-components)\n\n## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring\n\nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)\n\n### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring\n\nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.\n\n#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring\n\n##### Support via Personal Tutoring\n\nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.\n\nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\n- [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)\n\n### 9.2 Transition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\n- [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)\n\n### 9.3 Programming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.\n\n---\n## 10. Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\n### 10.1 Modules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\n### 10.2 Module availability\n\n#### Modules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\n#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\n- [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospectus/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/affiliate-module-registration)\n\n### 10.3 Module selection\n\n#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-new-students/pre-enrolment). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-continuing-students/re-enrolment).\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\n- [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection)\n\n##### Approval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\n##### Change of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\n##### Verification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\n#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/continuing-student-module-registration)\n\n#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:\n- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)\n- Students for whom the module is optional.\n- Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection#2.8)\n\n### 10.4 Module information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\n#### Module catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have [published module introduction videos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/module-introductions) to help inform module selection.\n\nThe [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\n#### Module deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\n#### Module timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\n### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\n#### Academic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\n#### Academic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\n#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.\n\n---\n## 11. Changes to registration status\n\nInformation on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.\n\n### 11.1 Changing registration status\n\nStudents wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies)\n- [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.2 Changing programme\n\nStudents wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.\n\nStudents must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Study Abroad and Placement Years\n\nStudents who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.3 Interruption of studies\n\nStudents needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.\n\nStudents who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nNote: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.\n\n- [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme\n\nStudents wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.\n\nStudents who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-withdrawing-programme)\n\n### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status\n\nIf a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\n### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.\n\n---\n## 12. Progression, award, and classification\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n### 12.1 Progression and award requirements\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.\n\nA programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.\n\n| Degree                                     | Progression and Award Regulations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |\n| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure. Specific regulations for programmes are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool.\n\nStudents will be notified when the regulations for their programme are available. To find the Tool, click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.\n\n#### MEng Computer Science progression threshold\n\nIn order to progress on MEng Computer Science, a student must have achieved the following, in addition to all other progression criteria:\n\n1.  At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.\n2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.\n\nThese thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.\n\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award)\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n\n### 12.2 Classification requirements\n\nInformation on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.\n\nIf a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).\n\nIf a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure.

Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\n### 13.1 Assessment\n\n#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\n#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |\n| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |\n| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |\n| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)\n\n#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\n##### Deliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\n##### Individual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\n##### Engagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\n##### Learning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n##### Marking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)\n\n#### 13.1.4 Marking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)\n\n### 13.2 Feedback\n\n#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\n##### UCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\n##### Computer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\n##### Computer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\n##### Computer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)\n\n### 13.3 Examinations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### Examination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:\n- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025\n- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\n#### Examination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\n- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)\n- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n#### Intercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).\n\n#### Computer Science past exam paper policy\n\n[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\n### 13.4 Coursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\n#### Coursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:\n- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)\n- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\n#### Coursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\n#### Support for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\n### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\n#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\n- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)\n\n#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\n| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6.

Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\n#### Application of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)\n\n### 13.7 Absence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\n#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:\n1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);\n2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;\n3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or\n4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\n#### Condonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)\n- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)\n- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:\n- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.\n- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.\n- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)\n\n#### Deferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\n- [Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/extenuating-circumstances)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-deferred-assessment)\n\n### 13.9 Academic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\n#### Academic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with:\n- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).\n- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.\n- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.\n- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:\n- referencing conventions;\n- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;\n- attribution of contributions in group work; and\n- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\n#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:\n- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)\n- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)\n- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\n#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\n#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n### 13.10 Research ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\n- [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/integrity/ucl-research-ethics)\n\n### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\n#### Computer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\n### 13.12 External examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Chapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-4-external-examining)\n\n---\n## 14.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.\n\nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.\n\n#### Assessment information on Moodle\n\nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)).\n\n#### Access to Moodle pages\n\nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.\n\n- [Moodle Resource Centre | UCL Wiki](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/MoodleResourceCentre)\n\n### 14.4 Portico\n\nInformation on Portico – what it is, why it is important and who to contact for support.\n\n[Portico](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/portico/) is the main UCL student information system which is used by both staff and students.

UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has [Report and Support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/report-support/), an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:\n- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment.\n- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.\n- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish.

Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.\n\nUndergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.\n\n#### Departmental research internships\n\nThe department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.\n\n#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')\n\nStudents who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.\n\n#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations\n\nStudent projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network).

One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\n#### Course Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\n#### Lead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\n#### Faculty  Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\n#### Elections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Academic Representatives | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/academic-representatives)\n- [Find your representative | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation)\n\n### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation#6.4)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-7-student-representation-ucl-academic-standing)\n\n### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\n#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.3 Student forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\n- [Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25380)\n\n### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:\n- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework\n- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries\n- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes\n- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts\n- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.  No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission.   Students can complete the [online contact form](https://studentsunionucl.org/forms/advice-service-contact-form) for advice and support.\n\n### 17.7 Student complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL.  However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\n#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\n| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |\n|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |\n|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |\n\nContact details are available as follows:\n- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).\n- Programme Leaders via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook](\n- Departmental Tutor and Faculty Tutor via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty | CS Student Handbook](\n- Course Representatives via in the [Directory of Academic Reps | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative).\n- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-8-student-complaints-procedure)\n- [Chapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-7-academic-appeals-procedure)\n\n---\n## 18. Student feedback\n\n### 18.1 The role of student feedback\n\nThe importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.\n\nOur goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:\n- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](\n- The student membership on UCL's committees.\n- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.\n- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.\n- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.\n- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\n- [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)\n- [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-feedback/survey-news-and-results)\n\n### 18.2 Student surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\n- [National Student Survey | Office for Students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/national-student-survey-nss/)\n- [Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/surveys/postgraduate-taught-experience-survey-ptes)\n\n### 18.3 Module dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\n### 18.4 UCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\n[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:\n- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.\n- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.\n- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.\n- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\n### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\n[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:\n- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;\n- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;\n- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;\n- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;\n- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.\n\n---\n## 19.

Volunteering Services\n\nInformation about the Students' Union UCL Volunteering Services and how to become involved.\n\n### 20.1 About Volunteering Services, who they are and how a student can find out more or become involved\n\nThe [Volunteering Service at Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering) exists to connect UCL students with London's Voluntary and Community Sector, primarily through volunteering.  It's one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.\n\nThe Service runs three main programmes:\n- Partnerships linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners.\n- Student-led Projects supporting students to set up and run their own community projects.\n- Community Research Initiative connecting master's students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations.\n\nThrough community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world.  UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their academic study and well-being.\n\nThe Volunteering Service's opportunities can be found on its [online directory](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering-directory), where students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by cause.  There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around their studies and other commitments.\n\n## 21. Data protection and intellectual property\n\nInformation on how UCL uses student information, for what purposes, and the steps taken to safeguard this information; where to find information security, intellectual property and email policies; Information on how to enquire or make a related complaint. Where to find information security, intellectual property, and email policies.\n\n### 21.1 Data protection (how UCL uses student information)\n\nUCL uses student information for a range of purposes, including the provision of teaching and learning, managing accommodation and ensuring health and safety. Further information about how UCL uses student information can be found in the [UCL General Student Privacy Notice](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/general-student-privacy-notice).\n\nStudents may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Information Security Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/information-security-policy)\n- [Email Usage Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/email-usage-policy)\n- [Data Protection Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/data-protection-policy)\n- [Understand your intellectual property (IP) rights | UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/students/support-students-and-alumni/ip-intellectual-property)\n- [Report a Breach of Personal Data | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/report-breach-personal-data)\n\n### 21.2 Storing and securing data\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the [Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg), for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.\n\nIf students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The [UCL Dropbox service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/dropbox-ucl) may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.\n\nIf students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.\n\n- [Information Security | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/)\n- [File storage & sharing | UCL Information Services Division](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing)\n- [Encryption | UCL Information Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/abcs-information-security/e-encryption)\n\n---\n## 22. Health, safety, and security\n\nInformation on UCL's health, safety and security policies and procedures.\n\n### 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL\n\nUCL's overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL's activities are managed and conducted.\n\nThere are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment:\n- [UCL Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl), who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;\n- [UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/), who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples;\n- [UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/) who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.\n\n- [Accidents and Emergencies | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies)\n- [Emergency contacts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/emergency-contacts)\n- [Staying safe | UCL Students - UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe)\n- [Fire Safety at UCL | UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/fire-safety)\n- [Safety on and off campus | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/safety-and-campus)\n- [SafeZone App | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/safezone-app)\n\n### 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science\n\nThe policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.\n\nThe department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.\n\n### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department\n\nStudents should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.\n\n---\n## 23.

The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)\n\n- [Confirmation of registration and award | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates)\n- [Students and council tax | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money/managing-your-money/council-tax)\n- [Money and finances | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money)\n\n### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)\n\nInformation on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.\n\n#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results\n\nA [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.\n\n##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)\n\nStudents may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.\n\n##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n##### Affiliate students\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.\n\nUCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).\n\n#### 23.4.2 Degree certificates\n\nA [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.\n\nGraduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)\n\n#### 23.4.3 Statements of award\n\nA statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)\n\n### 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)\n\nInformation about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)\n\nA [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.\n\nNew students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).\n\nEach summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\n### 23.6 Academic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\n### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:\n- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;\n- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\n### 23.8 UCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\n- [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services-alumni)\n- [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/alumni)\n\n---\n## 24. Keeping in touch\n\nDetails of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.\n\n### 24.1 Central and Faculty communication channels\n\nWe will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:\n\n| Channel           | Descriptor                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly.          |\n| Moodle            | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |\n| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |\n| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |\n| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n### 24.2 Computer Science communications\n\n#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams\n\nStudents will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.\n\nStudents should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.\n\n##### Mailing lists\n\nStudents will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.\n\n##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels\n\nConnected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.\n\n##### Access and technical support\n\nAccess to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.\n\n#### 24.2.2 Social media\n\nComputer Science is active on the following social media channels:\n- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.\n- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.\n- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)\n- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)\n\n##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions\n\nThe Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.\n\n##### Schedule\n\n- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)\n- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)\n\nYou can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.\n\nWe operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.\n\nPlease have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.\n\nYou will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.\n\n##### Important:\n\nThere will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.\n\n##### Personal Tutor Office Hours\n\nYour Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email ([b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk))\n\n##### Programme Director and Year Coordinator Office Hours\n\nProgramme Directors (or Deputy Programme Directors) and Academic Year Coordinators hold regular Office Hours.\n\n##### Undergraduate programmes (2)\n\nOffice Hours for undergraduate programmes are as follows:\n\n| Staff | Role | Day of the week | Times (24hr clock, UK time) | Mode (online/on- campus) | Location (on- campus) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ivana Drobnjak](https://search2.ucl.ac.uk/s/search.html?query=Ivana+Drobnjak&collection=website-meta&profile=_directory&tab=directory) | BSc/ MEng Computer Science | Thursday | 5pm -

Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.\n\nUCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.\n\nDr Michael Spence\n\nUCL President and Provost\n\n### 1.2 Head of Department's welcome\n\nWelcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science.\n\nOur discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\n### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n### 1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.\n\n---\n## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\n### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\n### 2.3 Key staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out

Hours of study\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)\n\n### 5.1 Teaching and learning\n\nInformation on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)\n\nStudents on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.\n\nSynchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.\n\n#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons\n\nThere is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)\n\n- [Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence#3.6)\n\n### 5.2 Personal study\n\nInformation on personal study time (Local.)\n\nActivities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.\n\n### 5.3 Attendance and engagement\n\nInformation on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)\n\n#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements\n\nUCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.\n\nThe Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.\n\nEach Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)\n\nStudents should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.\n\nStudents encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.\n\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n- [UCL Student Attendance Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy)\n- [Attendance at UCL | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/attendance-ucl)\n\n#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities\n\nIn line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.\n\n- [Immigration and visas | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas)\n- [Student visa responsibilities | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/student-visa-responsibilities)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n\n#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment\n\nIf a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under the [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).\n\n- [Extenuating Circumstances and Reasonable Adjustments | CS Student Handbook](\n\n---\n## 6. Our expectations of students\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations of students, including student conduct and engagement with their programme of study.\n\n### 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct\n\nUCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with UCL's Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL's Student Disciplinary Procedures.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [UCL Disciplinary Code and Procedure in Respect of Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-11-student-disciplinary-code-and-procedure)\n- [UCL Prevention of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-1-student-related-policy/prevention-bullying-harassment-and-sexual-misconduct-policy)\n- [UCL Code of Practice on Freedom of Speech | UCL Student and Registry Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/governance-and-committees/governance/freedom-speech)\n- [Religion and Belief Equality Policy for Students | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/religion-and-belief/religion-and-belief-equality-policy-students)\n\n---\n## 7.

The programme diets for the current academic year, referred to in the programme summary, are published via the [Computer Science study pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study).\n\n##### Undergraduate programmes\n...\n##### Postgraduate Taught programmes\n...\n\n### 8.3 Programme features and variations\n\n#### 8.3.1 Integrated Engineering Programme\n\nInformation on the Integrated Engineering Programme for participating undergraduate programmes.\n\nThe Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP) is a framework of modules and activities taken by students on participating undergraduate programmes across the Faculty of Engineering Sciences. The following Computer Science programmes participate in the IEP:\n- BSc Computer Science\n- BSc Computer Science (with Year in Industry)\n- MEng Computer Science\n- MEng Computer Science (with Year in Industry)\n\n##### Structure of programmes within the IEP\n\nThe IEP includes compulsory modules, an IEP Minor pathway, and the How to Change the World activity, which is structured as follows:\n\n| Year of Study | IEP components                                                              |\n| :---          | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1        | Design and Professional Skills (ENGF0001), Engineering Challenges (ENGF0034) |\n| Year 2        | IEP Minor module 1, How to Change the World (credited in Year 3)            |\n| Year 3        | IEP Minor module 2, IEP Minor module 3                                      |\n\nThe IEP Minor is a set of three linked modules in an engineering or other complimentary discipline (such as modern languages.). Students take the first module of their chosen Minor in Year 2 and the second and third modules of that Minor in Year 3. Students cannot change their Minor once commenced in Year 2.\n\n- [How we teach | UCL Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/integrated-engineering-programme-iep/how-we-teach)\n- [IEP Central (24/25) | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25381)\n\n#### 8.3.2 Integrated Study Abroad Year\n\nInformation on Integrated Study Abroad Year options for eligible MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Study Abroad Year, the academic requirements for taking a Year Abroad, and how to apply.\n\nAn Integrated Study Abroad Year is one undertaken at an approved international partner institution in Year 3 of a 4-Year MEng programme. Students follow the Year 3 curriculum of the partner institution (instead of the Year 3 UCL curriculum) and then resume the standard MEng curriculum when they return to UCL in Year 4.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Integrated Study Abroad Year\n\nThe structure of programmes including a Study Abroad Year is as follows:\n\n| BSc    | MEng          | MEng (with Integrated Study Abroad Year) |\n| :----- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1        | Year 1                                   |\n| Year 2 | Year 2        | Year 2                                   |\n| Year 3 | Year 3        | Year 3 (Study Abroad)                    |\n|        | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 4 (MEng)                            |\n\nStudents in Year 2 of MEng Computer Science and MEng Mathematical Computation may apply for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students in Year 2 of BSc Computer Science students must transfer to the MEng Computer Science programme in parallel to making an application for an Integrated Study Abroad Year. Students who are approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year will transfer to the corresponding MEng (International Programme), which includes the Study Abroad Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Go abroad website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/go-abroad/) to learn more about the ethos of the programme and whether it may be right for them. Those who may be interested in applying a Study Abroad Year should then seek advice from the Study Abroad Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.3 Additional Placement Year\n\nInformation about taking an Additional Placement Year for eligible BSc and MEng programmes, the structure of programmes with a Year in Industry, the academic requirements for taking a Year in Industry, and how to apply.\n\nAn Additional Placement Year is one undertaken working in industry between the penultimate and final year of a BSc or MEng programme. Students resume the standard curriculum when they return to UCL in the next year; this extends the length of the degree by one year.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Additional Placement Year\n\n| BSc    | BSc (Placement in between Years 2 and 3) | MEng          | MEng (Placement between Years 2 and 3) | MEng (Placement between Years 3 and 4) |\n| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1                                   | Year 1        | Year 1                                 | Year 1                                 |\n| Year 2 | Year 2                                   | Year 2        | Year 2                                 | Year 2                                 |\n| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year                | Year 3        | Additional Placement Year              | Year 3                                 |\n|        | Year 3                                   | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3                                 | Additional Placement Year              |\n|        |                                          |               | Year 4 (MEng)                          | Year 4 (MEng)                          |\n\nStudents who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application (2)\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Research-based education website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/research-based-education) to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects\n\nInformation about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.\n\nStudents will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the [UCL Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.\n\n### 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification\n\nMany UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally-recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.\n\n### 8.5 Module details\n\nProgrammes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n- [Section 10.1: Modules | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 7, Section 3: Framework Components | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-7-programme-and-module-design-and-approval-framework/section-3-framework-components)\n\n## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring\n\nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)\n\n### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring\n\nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.\n\n#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring\n\n##### Support via Personal Tutoring\n\nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.\n\nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\n- [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)\n\n### 9.2 Transition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\n- [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)\n\n### 9.3 Programming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.\n\n---\n## 10. Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\n### 10.1 Modules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\n### 10.2 Module availability\n\n#### Modules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\n#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\n- [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospectus/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/affiliate-module-registration)\n\n### 10.3 Module selection\n\n#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-new-students/pre-enrolment). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-continuing-students/re-enrolment).\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\n- [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection)\n\n##### Approval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\n##### Change of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\n##### Verification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\n#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/continuing-student-module-registration)\n\n#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:\n- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)\n- Students for whom the module is optional.\n- Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection#2.8)\n\n### 10.4 Module information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\n#### Module catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have [published module introduction videos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/module-introductions) to help inform module selection.\n\nThe [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\n#### Module deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\n#### Module timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\n### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\n#### Academic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\n#### Academic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\n#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.\n\n---\n## 11. Changes to registration status\n\nInformation on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.\n\n### 11.1 Changing registration status\n\nStudents wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies)\n- [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.2 Changing programme\n\nStudents wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.\n\nStudents must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Study Abroad and Placement Years\n\nStudents who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.3 Interruption of studies\n\nStudents needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.\n\nStudents who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nNote: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.\n\n- [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme\n\nStudents wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.\n\nStudents who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-withdrawing-programme)\n\n### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status\n\nIf a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\n### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.\n\n---\n## 12. Progression, award, and classification\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n### 12.1 Progression and award requirements\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.\n\nA programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.\n\n| Degree                                     | Progression and Award Regulations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |\n| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure.

To find the Tool, click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.\n\n#### MEng Computer Science progression threshold\n\nIn order to progress on MEng Computer Science, a student must have achieved the following, in addition to all other progression criteria:\n\n1.  At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.\n2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.\n\nThese thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.\n\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award)\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n\n### 12.2 Classification requirements\n\nInformation on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.\n\nIf a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).\n\nIf a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their programme regulations are available. To find the Tool, students should click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico.

Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\n### 13.1 Assessment\n\n#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\n#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |\n| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |\n| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |\n| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)\n\n#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\n##### Deliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\n##### Individual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\n##### Engagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\n##### Learning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n##### Marking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)\n\n#### 13.1.4 Marking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)\n\n### 13.2 Feedback\n\n#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\n##### UCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\n##### Computer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\n##### Computer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\n##### Computer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)\n\n### 13.3 Examinations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### Examination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:\n- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025\n- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\n#### Examination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\n- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)\n- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n#### Intercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).\n\n#### Computer Science past exam paper policy\n\n[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\n### 13.4 Coursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\n#### Coursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:\n- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)\n- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\n#### Coursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\n#### Support for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\n### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\n#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\n- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)\n\n#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\n| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |\n| 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late.                                                                                                                                              | Component mark capped at the module pass mark.                                     |                                                                                                                    |\n| Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) | Component mark of 1.00%.                                                           | Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                    |\n| Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners.                                                                       | Component mark of zero.                                                            | Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                          |\n\nWork submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.\n\n#### Application of late penalties\n\nLate penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\n#### Application of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)\n\n### 13.7 Absence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\n#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:\n1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);\n2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;\n3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or\n4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\n#### Condonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)\n- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)\n- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:\n- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.\n- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.\n- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)\n\n#### Deferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\n- [Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/extenuating-circumstances)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-deferred-assessment)\n\n### 13.9 Academic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\n#### Academic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with:\n- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).\n- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.\n- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.\n- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:\n- referencing conventions;\n- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;\n- attribution of contributions in group work; and\n- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\n#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:\n- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)\n- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)\n- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\n#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\n#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n### 13.10 Research ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\n- [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/integrity/ucl-research-ethics)\n\n### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\n#### Computer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\n### 13.12 External examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Chapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-4-external-examining)\n\n---\n## 14. Learning resources and key facilities\n\nInformation on university-wide learning resources, including library services, computer and software resources, and digital learning technologies.\n\n### 14.1 UCL Library and learning resources\n\n#### 14.1.1 UCL Library Services\n\nUCL Library Services provides support to students online and in person via our libraries. UCL has 14 libraries covering a wide range of specialist subjects with expert staff that students can ask for help. [UCL Library Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/) provides access to a huge range of digital and print resources.

UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has [Report and Support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/report-support/), an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:\n- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment.\n- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.\n- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish. The reports are strictly confidential and only shared on a need to know basis.\n\nStudents can request to speak to all the following advisors:\n- Dignity Advisor\n- Crime Prevention and Personal Safety Advisor\n- Human Resources Business Manager (if it’s about a member of staff)\n- Student Casework Team\n- Independent Sexual Violence Advisors\n- Student Support and Wellbeing\n\nThe department is committed to ensuring its staff and students are treated with dignity, and we strongly encourage students to report any instances of harassment or bullying they witness or experience.\n\n#### 15.4.2 Support for students who have been affected by sexual violence and/ or domestic abuse\n\nUCL will do its utmost to support anyone who has been, or is being, affected by [sexual violence and/or domestic abuse](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/sexual-misconduct-and-violence).

Employability and careers\n\n### 16.1 Computer Science careers\n\nInformation on careers resources within the department.\n\nComputer Science students have access to a careers tutor, who can provide guidance for accessing and making the most of careers resources at UCL.\n\n- **Computer Science Careers Tutor**: [Tigmanshu Bhatnagar](https://search2.ucl.ac.uk/s/search.html?query=Tigmanshu+Bhatnagar&collection=website-meta&profile=_directory&tab=directory)\n\n### 16.2 UCL careers\n\nInformation on UCL’s careers services for current students and recent graduates.\n\n[UCL Careers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/careers/) provides a wide variety of careers information, one-to-one guidance and events for UCL students and recent graduates. UCL Careers assists them through the entire job hunting process, including exploring options, searching for vacancies, preparing CVs and applications, practicing for interviews, aptitude tests or assessment centres, and providing access to recruitment fairs and other employment-related events. They can also advise on exploring options for further study and funding. Services and events are available to all taught students, researchers (PhD students and postdocs) and graduates (for up to three years after course completion).\n\nUCL Careers also supports employability activities within departments such as work-related learning and internships.\n\nUCL students are helped with applications and sourcing opportunities with web resources and advice. They can book appointments and search for internship and graduate job vacancies via [myUCLCareers](https://ucl.targetconnect.net/).\n\n### 16.3 Optional internships and placements\n\nInformation on optional internships that are not part of the programme.\n\nAn internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.\n\nUndergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.\n\n#### Departmental research internships\n\nThe department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.\n\n#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')\n\nStudents who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.\n\n#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations\n\nStudent projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.\n\n### 16.4 Entrepreneurship at UCL\n\nInformation on entrepreneurship and enterprise at UCL.\n\nUCL has a long and successful track record of supporting spin-outs and start-ups developed by its academic and student communities. Many of the student and staff entrepreneurs have won external awards and achieved substantial investment allowing their enterprises to grow and reach their full potential. [UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/) offers a wide range of support to students ranging from training programmes, advice on whether an idea has commercial potential, one-to-one sessions with business advisers, funding, competitions and incubator space to help them start or grow their business.\n\n## 17. Student representation and voice\n\n### 17.1 Students' Union UCL\n\nInformation on UCL Students' Union, how to run for election and how to find a student representative.\n\n[Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/) helps you to do more at UCL, experience something you've always dreamt of, turn a curiosity into a new passion and help you reach your potential.  The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.\n\nThe Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students.  It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL.  All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students.  The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students.  Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.\n\n- [Make a change | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change)\n\n### 17.2 Student clubs & societies\n\nInformation on student societies.\n\nAt Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in.  Maybe you are interested in sports with our TeamUCL clubs or low commitment exercise with our Project Active scheme? Perhaps you are keen to perform on-stage in the Bloomsbury Theatre or you want to learn about and celebrate different cultures?  With such a diverse offering available there is bound to be something that sparks your interest!  Clubs and societies are a great way to develop your skills and find a community at UCL.  The Welcome Fair in early October is the perfect chance to meet them all in one place and learn more about what they have on offer!\n\n#### UCL Technology Society\n\nThe society most relevant to Computer Science is the [Technology Society (TechSoc)](https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/technology-society), which has a large number of members from the department.  TechSoc puts on a full programme of events, from workshops to hackathons, tech talks by external speakers, and other social events.\n\n- [Clubs and societies | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies)\n- [What's on? | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/whats-on)\n\n### 17.3 Academic Representatives (Course Reps, Lead Departmental Reps, & Faculty Reps)\n\nStudents' Union UCL is there to make sure students have the best possible time while they are studying at UCL.  One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\n#### Course Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\n#### Lead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\n#### Faculty  Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\n#### Elections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Academic Representatives | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/academic-representatives)\n- [Find your representative | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation)\n\n### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation#6.4)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-7-student-representation-ucl-academic-standing)\n\n### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\n#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.3 Student forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\n- [Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25380)\n\n### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:\n- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework\n- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries\n- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes\n- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts\n- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.  No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission.   Students can complete the [online contact form](https://studentsunionucl.org/forms/advice-service-contact-form) for advice and support.\n\n### 17.7 Student complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL.  However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\n#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\n| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |\n|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |\n|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |\n\nContact details are available as follows:\n- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).\n- Programme Leaders via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook](\n- Departmental Tutor and Faculty Tutor via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty | CS Student Handbook](\n- Course Representatives via in the [Directory of Academic Reps | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative).\n- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-8-student-complaints-procedure)\n- [Chapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-7-academic-appeals-procedure)\n\n---\n## 18. Student feedback\n\n### 18.1 The role of student feedback\n\nThe importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.\n\nOur goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:\n- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](\n- The student membership on UCL's committees.\n- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.\n- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.\n- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.\n- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\n- [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)\n- [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-feedback/survey-news-and-results)\n\n### 18.2 Student surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\n- [National Student Survey | Office for Students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/national-student-survey-nss/)\n- [Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/surveys/postgraduate-taught-experience-survey-ptes)\n\n### 18.3 Module dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\n### 18.4 UCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\n[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:\n- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.\n- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.\n- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.\n- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\n### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\n[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:\n- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;\n- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;\n- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;\n- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;\n- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.\n\n---\n## 19.

The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.\n\nThe department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.\n\n### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department\n\nStudents should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.\n\n---\n## 23. After study\n\nInformation on confirmation of student status, transcripts and certificates, Higher Education Achievement Reports, academic references, and on UCL Alumni activities.\n\n### 23.1 Summary of options for confirmation of student status and award\n\nStudents and graduates may request evidence of their student status and academic record from UCL, including official statements, transcripts of results, and academic references. The [certificates and results pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates) set out detailed guidance on the types of documentation available, how to request these, and any restrictions that apply. The table below is intended to summarise that information; best efforts have been made to ensure it is correct.\n\n| Document (and link to more information) | Descriptor | Medium | How to acquire/ request | Eligibility | Notes |\n| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Statement of student status | An official letter that can used as proof of enrolment at UCL.

References should not include a student's rank order within their cohort. |\n\nAny module results and programme outcomes are provisional until confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners, and any recommended award is provisional until conferred by UCL Education Committee.\n\nTypically, the Board of Examiners meets once in the summer to confirm marks for modules taken in terms 1, 2, and 3 (including undergraduate projects/ dissertations), once in the late summer to confirm the results of late summer assessments, and once in the autumn to confirm marks for taught postgraduate projects/ dissertations.\n\nWhere a student's full set of module results is not available at a meeting of the programme Board of Examiners, for example because of an ongoing extension, deferral, or unresolved investigation under the academic misconduct regulations, then confirmation of results and conferral of any award may be delayed, subject to the availability of the Board of Examiners to review the delayed results. The department will endeavour to minimise any such delays and to make any recommendations for award as expeditiously as possible.\n\n### 23.3 Confirmation of student status (statement of student status)\n\nA statement of student status is an official letter that can used as proof of enrolment at UCL. The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)\n\n- [Confirmation of registration and award | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates)\n- [Students and council tax | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money/managing-your-money/council-tax)\n- [Money and finances | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money)\n\n### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)\n\nInformation on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.\n\n#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results\n\nA [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.\n\n##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)\n\nStudents may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.\n\n##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n##### Affiliate students\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.\n\nUCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).\n\n#### 23.4.2 Degree certificates\n\nA [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.\n\nGraduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)\n\n#### 23.4.3 Statements of award\n\nA statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)\n\n### 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)\n\nInformation about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)\n\nA [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.\n\nNew students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).\n\nEach summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\n### 23.6 Academic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\n### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:\n- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;\n- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\n### 23.8 UCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\n- [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services-alumni)\n- [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/alumni)\n\n---\n## 24. Keeping in touch\n\nDetails of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.\n\n### 24.1 Central and Faculty communication channels\n\nWe will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:\n\n| Channel           | Descriptor                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly.          |\n| Moodle            | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |\n| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |\n| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |\n| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n### 24.2 Computer Science communications\n\n#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams\n\nStudents will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.\n\nStudents should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.\n\n##### Mailing lists\n\nStudents will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.\n\n##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels\n\nConnected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.\n\n##### Access and technical support\n\nAccess to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.\n\n#### 24.2.2 Social media\n\nComputer Science is active on the following social media channels:\n- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.\n- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.\n- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)\n- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)\n\n##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions\n\nThe Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.\n\n##### Schedule\n\n- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)\n- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)\n\nYou can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.\n\nWe operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.\n\nPlease have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.\n\nYou will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.\n\n##### Important:\n\nThere will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.\n\n##### Personal Tutor Office Hours\n\nYour Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email ([b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk))\n\n##### Programme Director and Year Coordinator Office Hours\n\nProgramme Directors (or Deputy Programme Directors) and Academic Year Coordinators hold regular Office Hours.\n\n##### Undergraduate programmes (2)\n\nOffice Hours for undergraduate programmes are as follows:\n\n| Staff | Role | Day of the week | Times (24hr clock, UK time) | Mode (online/on- campus) | Location (on- campus) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ivana Drobnjak](https://search2.ucl.ac.uk/s/search.html?query=Ivana+Drobnjak&collection=website-meta&profile=_directory&tab=directory) | BSc/ MEng Computer Science | Thursday | 5pm -

      "\n## 1. Introduction and welcome\n\nWelcome messages from UCL's President and Provost and the Computer Science Head of Department, information about the scope and purpose of the Student Handbook, and general advice about changes to information through the year.\n\n### 1.1 Provost's welcome\n\nDear students,\n\nA warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back.\n\nYour UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future.\n\nWe want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL's research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges.\n\nI warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better.  Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience.\n\nThis is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.\n\nUCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.\n\nDr Michael Spence\n\nUCL President and Provost\n\n### 1.2 Head of Department's welcome\n\nWelcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science.\n\nOur discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\n### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n### 1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.\n\n---\n## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\n### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\n### 2.3 Key staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out key role-holders within the department and faculty, i.e. those roles with over-arching responsibilities.\n\n#### Departmental senior management\n\n| Role                        | Contact

Hours of study\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)\n\n### 5.1 Teaching and learning\n\nInformation on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)\n\nStudents on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.\n\nSynchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.\n\n#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons\n\nThere is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)\n\n- [Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence#3.6)\n\n### 5.2 Personal study\n\nInformation on personal study time (Local.)\n\nActivities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.\n\n### 5.3 Attendance and engagement\n\nInformation on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)\n\n#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements\n\nUCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.\n\nThe Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.\n\nEach Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)\n\nStudents should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.\n\nStudents encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.\n\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n- [UCL Student Attendance Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy)\n- [Attendance at UCL | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/attendance-ucl)\n\n#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities\n\nIn line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.\n\n- [Immigration and visas | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas)\n- [Student visa responsibilities | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/student-visa-responsibilities)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n\n#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment\n\nIf a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under the [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).\n\n- [Extenuating Circumstances and Reasonable Adjustments | CS Student Handbook](\n\n---\n## 6.

Personal tutoring\n\n##### Support via Personal Tutoring\n\nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.\n\nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\n- [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)\n\n### 9.2 Transition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\n- [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)\n\n### 9.3 Programming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.\n\n---\n## 10. Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\n### 10.1 Modules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\n### 10.2 Module availability\n\n#### Modules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\n#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\n- [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospectus/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/affiliate-module-registration)\n\n### 10.3 Module selection\n\n#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-new-students/pre-enrolment). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-continuing-students/re-enrolment).\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\n- [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection)\n\n##### Approval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\n##### Change of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\n##### Verification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\n#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/continuing-student-module-registration)\n\n#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:\n- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)\n- Students for whom the module is optional.\n- Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection#2.8)\n\n### 10.4 Module information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\n#### Module catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have [published module introduction videos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/module-introductions) to help inform module selection.\n\nThe [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\n#### Module deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\n#### Module timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\n### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\n#### Academic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\n#### Academic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\n#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.\n\n---\n## 11. Changes to registration status\n\nInformation on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.\n\n### 11.1 Changing registration status\n\nStudents wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies)\n- [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.2 Changing programme\n\nStudents wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.\n\nStudents must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Study Abroad and Placement Years\n\nStudents who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.3 Interruption of studies\n\nStudents needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.\n\nStudents who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nNote: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.\n\n- [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme\n\nStudents wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.\n\nStudents who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-withdrawing-programme)\n\n### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status\n\nIf a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\n### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.\n\n---\n## 12. Progression, award, and classification\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n### 12.1 Progression and award requirements\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.\n\nA programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.\n\n| Degree                                     | Progression and Award Regulations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |\n| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure.

At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.\n2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.\n\nThese thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.\n\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award)\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n\n### 12.2 Classification requirements\n\nInformation on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.\n\nIf a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).\n\nIf a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure. Specific regulations for each individual programme are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool. Students will be notified when their programme regulations are available.

Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\n### 13.1 Assessment\n\n#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\n#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |\n| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |\n| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |\n| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)\n\n#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\n##### Deliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\n##### Individual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\n##### Engagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\n##### Learning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n##### Marking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)\n\n#### 13.1.4 Marking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)\n\n### 13.2 Feedback\n\n#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\n##### UCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\n##### Computer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\n##### Computer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\n##### Computer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)\n\n### 13.3 Examinations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### Examination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:\n- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025\n- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\n#### Examination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\n- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)\n- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n#### Intercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).\n\n#### Computer Science past exam paper policy\n\n[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\n### 13.4 Coursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\n#### Coursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:\n- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)\n- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\n#### Coursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\n#### Support for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\n### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\n#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\n- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)\n\n#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\n| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. |\n| 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late.                                                                                                                                              | Component mark capped at the module pass mark.                                     |                                                                                                                    |\n| Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) | Component mark of 1.00%.                                                           | Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                    |\n| Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners.                                                                       | Component mark of zero.                                                            | Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided.                                                          |\n\nWork submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission.\n\n#### Application of late penalties\n\nLate penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\n#### Application of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)\n\n### 13.7 Absence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\n#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:\n1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);\n2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;\n3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or\n4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\n#### Condonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)\n- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)\n- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:\n- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.\n- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.\n- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)\n\n#### Deferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\n- [Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/extenuating-circumstances)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-deferred-assessment)\n\n### 13.9 Academic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\n#### Academic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with:\n- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).\n- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.\n- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.\n- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:\n- referencing conventions;\n- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;\n- attribution of contributions in group work; and\n- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\n#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:\n- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)\n- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)\n- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\n#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\n#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n### 13.10 Research ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\n- [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/integrity/ucl-research-ethics)\n\n### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\n#### Computer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\n### 13.12 External examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Chapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-4-external-examining)\n\n---\n## 14.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.\n\nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.\n\n#### Assessment information on Moodle\n\nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)).\n\n#### Access to Moodle pages\n\nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.\n\n- [Moodle Resource Centre | UCL Wiki](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/MoodleResourceCentre)\n\n### 14.4 Portico\n\nInformation on Portico – what it is, why it is important and who to contact for support.\n\n[Portico](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/portico/) is the main UCL student information system which is used by both staff and students.

They can book appointments and search for internship and graduate job vacancies via [myUCLCareers](https://ucl.targetconnect.net/).\n\n### 16.3 Optional internships and placements\n\nInformation on optional internships that are not part of the programme.\n\nAn internship is a period of work experience undertaken with an employer as means of gaining skills and experience in a field related to their programme of study. Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.\n\nUndergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.\n\n#### Departmental research internships\n\nThe department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.\n\n#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')\n\nStudents who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.\n\n#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations\n\nStudent projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Some projects may involve full-time on-site engagement with the partner, whilst others involve working remotely and only visiting the industry partner for necessary supervisory meetings.\n\n### 16.4 Entrepreneurship at UCL\n\nInformation on entrepreneurship and enterprise at UCL.\n\nUCL has a long and successful track record of supporting spin-outs and start-ups developed by its academic and student communities.

The Union cares about the things you care about, it's made up of all kinds of people from all kinds of places and it's there to fight for you when you need someone in your corner.\n\nThe Students' Union is the representative body of all UCL students.  It's run by students for students and is a registered charity, independent of UCL.  All UCL students at every level of study are automatically members of the Students' Union (but can opt out), and student leaders are elected annually by and from all current students.  The elected student leaders who work full time for you are called Sabbatical Officers and they represent students on various UCL committees and influence decisions that matter to students.  Alongside the Sabbatical Officers there are more than 2000 other student representatives, who cover every part of UCL life, from your programme, research studies, department, and faculty.\n\n- [Make a change | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change)\n\n### 17.2 Student clubs & societies\n\nInformation on student societies.\n\nAt Students' Union UCL, there are over 400 different student-led clubs and societies for you to get involved in.

One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\n#### Course Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\n#### Lead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\n#### Faculty  Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\n#### Elections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Academic Representatives | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/academic-representatives)\n- [Find your representative | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation)\n\n### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation#6.4)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-7-student-representation-ucl-academic-standing)\n\n### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\n#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.3 Student forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\n- [Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25380)\n\n### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:\n- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework\n- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries\n- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes\n- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts\n- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.

However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\n#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\n| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |\n|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |\n|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |\n\nContact details are available as follows:\n- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).\n- Programme Leaders via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook](\n- Departmental Tutor and Faculty Tutor via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty | CS Student Handbook](\n- Course Representatives via in the [Directory of Academic Reps | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative).\n- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-8-student-complaints-procedure)\n- [Chapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-7-academic-appeals-procedure)\n\n---\n## 18. Student feedback\n\n### 18.1 The role of student feedback\n\nThe importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.\n\nOur goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:\n- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](\n- The student membership on UCL's committees.\n- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.\n- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.\n- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.\n- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\n- [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)\n- [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-feedback/survey-news-and-results)\n\n### 18.2 Student surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\n- [National Student Survey | Office for Students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/national-student-survey-nss/)\n- [Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/surveys/postgraduate-taught-experience-survey-ptes)\n\n### 18.3 Module dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\n### 18.4 UCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\n[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:\n- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.\n- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.\n- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.\n- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\n### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\n[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:\n- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;\n- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;\n- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;\n- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;\n- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.\n\n---\n## 19.

Volunteering Services\n\nInformation about the Students' Union UCL Volunteering Services and how to become involved.\n\n### 20.1 About Volunteering Services, who they are and how a student can find out more or become involved\n\nThe [Volunteering Service at Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering) exists to connect UCL students with London's Voluntary and Community Sector, primarily through volunteering.  It's one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.\n\nThe Service runs three main programmes:\n- Partnerships linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners.\n- Student-led Projects supporting students to set up and run their own community projects.\n- Community Research Initiative connecting master's students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations.\n\nThrough community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world.  UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their academic study and well-being.\n\nThe Volunteering Service's opportunities can be found on its [online directory](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering-directory), where students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by cause.  There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around their studies and other commitments.\n\n## 21.

Where to find information security, intellectual property, and email policies.\n\n### 21.1 Data protection (how UCL uses student information)\n\nUCL uses student information for a range of purposes, including the provision of teaching and learning, managing accommodation and ensuring health and safety. Further information about how UCL uses student information can be found in the [UCL General Student Privacy Notice](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/general-student-privacy-notice).\n\nStudents may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Information Security Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/information-security-policy)\n- [Email Usage Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/email-usage-policy)\n- [Data Protection Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/data-protection-policy)\n- [Understand your intellectual property (IP) rights | UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/students/support-students-and-alumni/ip-intellectual-property)\n- [Report a Breach of Personal Data | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/report-breach-personal-data)\n\n### 21.2 Storing and securing data\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the [Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg), for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.\n\nIf students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The [UCL Dropbox service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/dropbox-ucl) may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.\n\nIf students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.\n\n- [Information Security | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/)\n- [File storage & sharing | UCL Information Services Division](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing)\n- [Encryption | UCL Information Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/abcs-information-security/e-encryption)\n\n---\n## 22. Health, safety, and security\n\nInformation on UCL's health, safety and security policies and procedures.\n\n### 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL\n\nUCL's overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL's activities are managed and conducted.\n\nThere are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment:\n- [UCL Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl), who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;\n- [UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/), who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples;\n- [UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/) who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.\n\n- [Accidents and Emergencies | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies)\n- [Emergency contacts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/emergency-contacts)\n- [Staying safe | UCL Students - UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe)\n- [Fire Safety at UCL | UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/fire-safety)\n- [Safety on and off campus | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/safety-and-campus)\n- [SafeZone App | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/safezone-app)\n\n### 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science\n\nThe policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.\n\nThe department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.\n\n### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department\n\nStudents should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.\n\n---\n## 23. After study\n\nInformation on confirmation of student status, transcripts and certificates, Higher Education Achievement Reports, academic references, and on UCL Alumni activities.\n\n### 23.1 Summary of options for confirmation of student status and award\n\nStudents and graduates may request evidence of their student status and academic record from UCL, including official statements, transcripts of results, and academic references.

The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)\n\n- [Confirmation of registration and award | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates)\n- [Students and council tax | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money/managing-your-money/council-tax)\n- [Money and finances | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money)\n\n### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)\n\nInformation on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.\n\n#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results\n\nA [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.\n\n##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)\n\nStudents may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.\n\n##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n##### Affiliate students\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.\n\nUCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).\n\n#### 23.4.2 Degree certificates\n\nA [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.\n\nGraduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)\n\n#### 23.4.3 Statements of award\n\nA statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)\n\n### 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)\n\nInformation about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)\n\nA [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.\n\nNew students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).\n\nEach summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\n### 23.6 Academic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\n### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:\n- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;\n- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\n### 23.8 UCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\n- [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services-alumni)\n- [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/alumni)\n\n---\n## 24.

Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |\n| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |\n| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |\n| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n### 24.2 Computer Science communications\n\n#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams\n\nStudents will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.\n\nStudents should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.\n\n##### Mailing lists\n\nStudents will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.\n\n##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels\n\nConnected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.\n\n##### Access and technical support\n\nAccess to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.\n\n#### 24.2.2 Social media\n\nComputer Science is active on the following social media channels:\n- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.\n- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.\n- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)\n- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)\n\n##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions\n\nThe Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.\n\n##### Schedule\n\n- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)\n- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)\n\nYou can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.\n\nWe operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.\n\nPlease have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.\n\nYou will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.\n\n##### Important:\n\nThere will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.\n\n##### Personal Tutor Office Hours\n\nYour Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email ([b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk))\n\n##### Programme Director and Year Coordinator Office Hours\n\nProgramme Directors (or Deputy Programme Directors) and Academic Year Coordinators hold regular Office Hours.\n\n##### Undergraduate programmes (2)\n\nOffice Hours for undergraduate programmes are as follows:\n\n| Staff | Role | Day of the week | Times (24hr clock, UK time) | Mode (online/on- campus) | Location (on- campus) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ivana Drobnjak](https://search2.ucl.ac.uk/s/search.html?query=Ivana+Drobnjak&collection=website-meta&profile=_directory&tab=directory) | BSc/ MEng Computer Science | Thursday | 5pm -

It will have profound influence on life on Earth.  It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.\n\nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.\n\nOne word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences.  We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact.  We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.  The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.\n\nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.  Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future.  And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.\n\nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.\n\nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department\n\n### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome\n\nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.\n\nWe are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.\n\nIn addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the Teaching and Learning contact page.\n\nYou have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.\n\nA key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the student intranet.\n\nYou can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.\n\nBest wishes for the year ahead.\n\nLewis Griffin & Jo Stiles\n\nDepartmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager\n\n### 1.4 About the Student Handbook\n\nThe Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life - sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.\n\nWhere information is available via [UCL Students webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) or in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual). If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.\n\n---\n## 2. Introduction to the department and faculty\n\nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.\n\n### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history\n\nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.\n\nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.\n\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.\n\nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.\n\n### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department\n\nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.\n\nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.\n\nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.\n\nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.\n\n### 2.3 Key staff in the department and faculty\n\nThis section sets out key role-holders within the department and faculty, i.e. those roles with over-arching responsibilities.\n\n#### Departmental senior management\n\n| Role                        | Contact

Hours of study\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations with respect to the number of hours students should spend engaged in study, requirements for attendance and engagement, and concerning authorisation of absence from assessment (Central and Local.)\n\n### 5.1 Teaching and learning\n\nInformation on the expected hours of study required (Central and Local.)\n\nStudents on full-time programmes are expected to devote approximately 40 hours per week to their study during term time. This time is made up of formal learning and teaching events such as synchronous lectures, tutorials, and computer lab sessions, as well as asynchronous activities, independent study, and working on assessments.\n\nSynchronous teaching activity is usually timetabled Monday to Friday between 08:00 and 20:00 (UK time.). If a student is required to choose optional or elective modules, then they should consider carefully the workload distribution and timetable that results from those choices, before finalising their selections. Not all combinations of optional and elective modules will be possible, as some synchronous activity may be timetabled in parallel. Timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, and whole programmes can be generated via the UCL Timetable.\n\n#### Undergraduate study on Wednesday afternoons\n\nThere is usually no synchronous teaching activity for undergraduate modules (Levels 4, 5, and 6) on Wednesday afternoons. This does not apply for MEng modules (i.e. those with deliveries at Level 7, as they are taken by taught postgraduate students.)\n\n- [Teaching on Wednesday Afternoons | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence#3.6)\n\n### 5.2 Personal study\n\nInformation on personal study time (Local.)\n\nActivities such as completing coursework, reading, research, and revision are assumed to be part of personal study time, which is not part of synchronous timetabled activity. Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor.\n\n### 5.3 Attendance and engagement\n\nInformation on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.)\n\n#### 5.3.1 Attendance requirements\n\nUCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials.\n\nThe Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25.\n\nEach Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the [UCL Student Attendance Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy). Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.)\n\nStudents should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent.\n\nStudents encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.\n\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n- [UCL Student Attendance Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/annex-32-student-attendance-policy)\n- [Attendance at UCL | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/attendance-ucl)\n\n#### 5.3.2 Student Visa students: Absence from teaching and learning activities\n\nIn line with UCL's obligations under UK immigration laws, UCL is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) when a student has not been engaging with their studies. RegisterUCL is used by departments and the central Student Immigration Compliance team to report on student attendance. This is not only to meet the UKVI requirements, but also to identify any problems as early as possible to ensure action is taken to advise or assist the student.\n\n- [Immigration and visas | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas)\n- [Student visa responsibilities | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/student-visa-responsibilities)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 3: Attendance and Absence | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-attendance-and-absence)\n\n#### 5.3.3 All students: absence from assessment\n\nIf a student experiences extenuating circumstances that prevents them from attending a scheduled assessment activity or submitting work by the relevant deadline, then they should submit an application under the [Short-term Illness and Extenuating Circumstances procedure](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances).\n\n- [Extenuating Circumstances and Reasonable Adjustments | CS Student Handbook](\n\n---\n## 6. Our expectations of students\n\nInformation on UCL's expectations of students, including student conduct and engagement with their programme of study.\n\n### 6.1 UCL Code of Conduct\n\nUCL enjoys a reputation as a world-class university. It was founded on the basis of equal opportunity, being the first English university to admit students irrespective of their faith and cultural background and the first to admit women. UCL expects its members to refrain from interfering with the proper functioning or activities of UCL, or of those who work or study at UCL. Students should ensure they read and familiarise themselves with UCL's Student Code of Conduct and other related policies and should be aware that any inappropriate behaviour may lead to actions under UCL's Student Disciplinary Procedures.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [UCL Disciplinary Code and Procedure in Respect of Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-11-student-disciplinary-code-and-procedure)\n- [UCL Prevention of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-1-student-related-policy/prevention-bullying-harassment-and-sexual-misconduct-policy)\n- [UCL Code of Practice on Freedom of Speech | UCL Student and Registry Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/srs/governance-and-committees/governance/freedom-speech)\n- [Religion and Belief Equality Policy for Students | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/religion-and-belief/religion-and-belief-equality-policy-students)\n\n---\n## 7.

Students resume the standard curriculum when they return to UCL in the next year; this extends the length of the degree by one year.\n\n##### Structure of programmes with an Additional Placement Year\n\n| BSc    | BSc (Placement in between Years 2 and 3) | MEng          | MEng (Placement between Years 2 and 3) | MEng (Placement between Years 3 and 4) |\n| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n| Year 1 | Year 1                                   | Year 1        | Year 1                                 | Year 1                                 |\n| Year 2 | Year 2                                   | Year 2        | Year 2                                 | Year 2                                 |\n| Year 3 | Additional Placement Year                | Year 3        | Additional Placement Year              | Year 3                                 |\n|        | Year 3                                   | Year 4 (MEng) | Year 3                                 | Additional Placement Year              |\n|        |                                          |               | Year 4 (MEng)                          | Year 4 (MEng)                          |\n\nStudents who are approved to take an Additional Placement Year will transfer to the corresponding 'Year in Industry' programme, which includes the Placement Year.\n\n##### Guidance and application (2)\n\nStudents should review the [UCL Research-based education website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/research-based-education) to learn more about placements in industry and whether it may be right for them. Students who may be interested in applying for an Additional Placement Year should then seek advice from their Academic Year Coordinator and Year in Industry Tutor.\n\n#### 8.3.4 Academic and Industrial Final Year Projects\n\nInformation about taking an academic or industry project for the final Dissertational/ Project module.\n\nStudents will take a Final Dissertation/ Project, which may be an academic project or one with an industry partner, organised via the [UCL Industry Exchange Network](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network). Each student will be allocated to a project and given an academic supervisor who will guide them.\n\n### 8.4 Professional accreditation and certification\n\nMany UCL Qualifications are recognised or accredited by Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs), which are legally-recognised bodies that accredit, recognise, or endorse graduates from specific UCL programmes as qualified to act within a recognised profession or which leads to initial registration or supports enhanced registration with that body. Where programmes are professionally accredited or certified, students may be required to achieve specific conditions, which may be in addition to the standard UCL requirements, in order to be eligible for registration with the accrediting body.\n\n### 8.5 Module details\n\nProgrammes are composed of modules, which are individual units of study which lead to the award of credit. The Programme Diet specifies which modules are included in the programme.  Information about modules, their syllabuses, learning outcomes, and assessment methods is available via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n- [Section 10.1: Modules | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 7, Section 3: Framework Components | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-7-programme-and-module-design-and-approval-framework/section-3-framework-components)\n\n## 9. Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring\n\nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)\n\n### 9.1 Personal and academic tutoring\n\nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.\n\n#### 9.1.1. Personal tutoring\n\n##### Support via Personal Tutoring\n\nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.\n\nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.\n\nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.\n\nTutors will not be available every week, since all staff are required to take leave on occasion and will have competing demands on their time. However, staff will communicate their availability to their tutees.\n\n- [Personal tutors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/personal-tutors)\n\n### 9.2 Transition mentoring\n\nInformation on the UCL Transition Mentors programme for first year undergraduate students.\n\nThe UCL Transition Programme supports new undergraduate first-year students at UCL, helping them to settle in quickly and achieve their potential. Each first-year student is assigned a Transition Mentor for Term 1. Transition mentors are later-year students within the department who work with small groups of students on a weekly basis to help them settle into UCL and London as well as focussing on academic issues and topics specific to their degree programme.\n\nFirst-year undergraduate students meet their Transition Mentor during the first week of term at the Meet your Mentor session, which is part of the scheduled programme of induction events.\n\n- [Transition Mentors | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-support/transition-mentors)\n\n### 9.3 Programming tutoring\n\nInformation on Computer Science's Programming Tutoring Scheme for new undergraduate students.\n\nAll Year 1 undergraduate students will be assigned a Programming Tutor at the start of the academic year as part of the Computer Science Programming Tutoring Scheme.\n\nThe scheme is a student-led initiative wherein undergraduate students in Years 2-4 can apply to act as Programming Tutors to provide small-group support to students in Year 1 of their undergraduate studies. The scheme supports beginner programmers towards proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3, and enables more advanced programmers to hone their skills. The scheme is coordinated by Senior Programming Tutors, who are responsible for recruiting and assigning Programming Tutors and for liaising with the department's staff.\n\n---\n## 10. Module information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\n### 10.1 Modules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\n### 10.2 Module availability\n\n#### Modules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\n#### Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\n- [Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospectus/study-abroad-at-ucl/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/affiliate-module-registration)\n\n### 10.3 Module selection\n\n#### 10.3.1 Choosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed [pre-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-new-students/pre-enrolment). Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed [re-enrolment](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/enrolment-continuing-students/re-enrolment).\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\n- [Module selection | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection)\n\n##### Approval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\n##### Change of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\n##### Verification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\n#### 10.3.2 Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Continuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/module-selection/continuing-student-module-registration)\n\n#### 10.3.3 Availability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority:\n- Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.)\n- Students for whom the module is optional.\n- Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\n#### 10.3.4 Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\n- [Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection)\n- [Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-module-selection#2.8)\n\n### 10.4 Module information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\n#### Module catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue), which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have [published module introduction videos](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/module-introductions) to help inform module selection.\n\nThe [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue) shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\n#### Module deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\n#### Module timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the [UCL Common Timetable](https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk/), which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.\n\nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.\n\n### 10.5 Key contacts for module selection\n\nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.\n\n#### Academic advice on module selection\n\nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.\n\nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.\n\n#### Academic advice on specific modules\n\nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.\n\n#### Administrative advice and troubleshooting\n\nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.\n\n---\n## 11. Changes to registration status\n\nInformation on how to interrupt study, change or withdraw from a programme.\n\n### 11.1 Changing registration status\n\nStudents wishing to make changes to their programme registration status (for example, transferring programme, interrupting their studies, or withdrawing), should first discuss their plans with their Personal Tutor or Project/ Dissertation Supervisor who can explain the options available and help them make the right decision. Students should also ensure they read the relevant sections of the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes) before making any requests to change their academic record.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Change your programme or modules | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies)\n- [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.2 Changing programme\n\nStudents wishing to transfer from one UCL degree programme to another, must make a formal application. For programmes with a September intake, the deadline for a change of degree programme during the same academic session is the end of October (in order to be compatible with module selection deadlines). Later transfers may be possible where the transfer does not affect module selections.\n\nStudents must discuss any proposed programme transfer with both departments before requesting a change of programme; once agreed in principle, students should request the programme transfer via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Study Abroad and Placement Years\n\nStudents who have been approved to take an Integrated Study Abroad Year or Additional Placement Year in the ensuring academic year, must apply to transfer to the relevant International Programme/ Year in Industry programme via Portico under the 'C2RS Home' menu by the deadline given in [Section 4: Key dates | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.3 Interruption of studies\n\nStudents needing a temporary break from their studies and plan to resume their programme at a future date, are advised to first speak to their Personal Tutor to discuss this and to ensure they fully understand the procedure and how this works in practice.\n\nStudents who do then decide they do wish to interrupt must apply online via Portico, and can access the 'Apply for an Interruption of Study' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nNote: For any assessment deadlines that fall between the submission of the request and the date it is approved: where a student is unable to submit them, they must apply for deferral via the 'short-term illness and other extenuating circumstances' process.  This is because incomplete assessments prior to the start of the interruption are not deferred by default and will otherwise be recorded as absent, meaning the student will have used their first attempt.\n\n- [Interruption of Study | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Interrupting or withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Section 7: Interruption of Study | CS Student Handbook](\n\n### 11.4 Withdrawing from a programme\n\nStudents wishing to leave their degree programme prior to completing their final assessments are strongly advised to first discuss this with their Personal Tutor or Programme Director, as there may be support options available.\n\nStudents who do then decide they wish to withdraw, must apply online via Portico and can access the 'Withdraw from your programme' form in the 'Change of Circumstances' section of 'My Studies'.\n\nApplications must be made in advance of the effective date of change.\n\n- [Withdrawing from your studies | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/changes-your-studies/interrupting-or-withdrawing-your-studies)\n- [Chapter 3, Section 7: Withdrawing from a programme | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-3-registration-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-withdrawing-programme)\n\n### 11.5 Informing the Student Loans Company of changes to student status\n\nIf a student makes a change to their programme or registration status during the course of the academic year, it is important that the Student Loans Company (SLC) is notified. The SLC can then re-assess and update its records. Changes could include a student withdrawing from their academic programme, an interruption in studies or transferring to a new programme. The SLC must also be notified when there is a change in mode of study or when a student has returned from an interruption.\n\nIf a student experiences a change of status, they must request for a Change of Circumstance Form to be submitted to the SLC on their behalf by the Faculty. Any queries should be directed in the first instance to the Programme Administrator.\n\n### 11.6 Key contacts for changes to programme registration status\n\nIf a student wishes to change their module selections, transfer to a different programme of study within UCL, interrupt their studies, or withdraw from their programme entirely, they should contact their Personal Tutor or Programme Director for advice and guidance in the first instance. The Programme Administrator (Undergraduate students should contact [cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.undergraduate-students@ucl.ac.uk) and Postgraduate Taught students should contact [cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.pgt-students@ucl.ac.uk)) is able to provide procedural advice, but cannot advise on the academic merits of a decision to change status.\n\n---\n## 12. Progression, award, and classification\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme, including what a student needs to complete and pass to be awarded a degree; what are the consequences of unsatisfactory progress.\n\n### 12.1 Progression and award requirements\n\nInformation on how a student progresses through the programme; what does a student need to complete and pass to be awarded a degree.\n\nA programme's progression and award requirements define how many credits, and at what levels, students need to pass in order to progress from one year of study to the next (in the case of undergraduate programmes) and to be awarded a UCL qualification.\n\n| Degree                                     | Progression and Award Regulations                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Bachelors and Integrated Masters Degrees   | Computer Science BSc and MEng programmes use the [Honours Degree Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.5). |\n| Masters Degrees                            | Computer Science MSc and MRes programmes use the [Masters Progression and Award Requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.10).     |\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme's structure. Specific regulations for programmes are published in the Portico Progression and Award Rules Tool.\n\nStudents will be notified when the regulations for their programme are available. To find the Tool, click on the 'My Programme' box on the 'My Studies' page in Portico. The 'Progression and Award Rules' link is below the programme information.\n\n#### MEng Computer Science progression threshold\n\nIn order to progress on MEng Computer Science, a student must have achieved the following, in addition to all other progression criteria:\n\n1.  At the end of year two: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one and two, with year one weighted 1 and year two weighted 3.\n2.  At the end of year three: an average of at least 55.00%, calculated across all modules in years one, two and three with year one weighted 1, year two weighted 3 and year three weighted 5.\n\nThese thresholds apply to students first registered in 2024/25 and thereafter only.\n\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6: Progression & Award | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award)\n- [Portico | UCL](https://evision.ucl.ac.uk/urd/sits.urd/run/siw_lgn)\n\n### 12.2 Classification requirements\n\nInformation on how marks will be combined to reach an award classification.\n\nIf a student successfully completes the Progression and Award Requirements for their programme, they will be awarded a Classification. A classification is a scheme that is used to differentiate levels of attainment of those awarded a qualification. The classification schemes of each of UCL's qualifications is set out in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Section 7: Classification | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-7-classification)).\n\nIf a student meets their programme's progression and award requirements, they will be recommended for an award. If the award is eligible for classification, they will be awarded a classification according to the programme's classification scheme. Interim awards (lower awards made where an eligible student does not meet the requirements for their final award) are not eligible for classification.\n\nThe regulations work slightly differently depending on the programme structure.

Assessment and feedback\n\nInformation on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks.\n\n### 13.1 Assessment\n\n#### 13.1.1 Overview of assessment\n\nAll taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes.\n\nA variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation.\n\nAssessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.\n\nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.\n\n#### 13.1.2 Assessment structure\n\nEach module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'.\n\nAn example assessment pattern for a module:\n\n| #   | Method (or type)      | Title                     | Weight (%) |\n| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1   | Coursework            | Coursework 1              | 15         |\n| 2   | Coursework            | Coursework 2              | 25         |\n| 3   | Open book examination | Online remote examination | 60         |\n\nEach module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue). In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section.\n\nStudents who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment)\n\n#### 13.1.3 Assessment tasks and their deadlines\n\nInformation on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them.\n\nEach summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks.\n\n##### Deliverables\n\nAn assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables.\n\nWhere a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.)\n\n##### Individual and group work\n\nAn assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.)\n\nOften, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task.\n\nThe task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment.\n\n##### Engagement in group assessment activity\n\nAll members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately.\n\nWhere upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published.\n\n##### Learning outcomes\n\nEach programme and module has a set of defined learning outcomes, which are statements that describe the skills and knowledge that a student will possess and/ or be able to demonstrate on their successful completion. The purpose of summative assessment is to test students' achievement of one or more of the owning module's learning outcomes. In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes.\n\nA module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the [UCL Module Catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue).\n\n##### Marking criteria\n\nEach task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out.\n\nSummative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-2-assessment-information)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-4-marking-and-moderation)\n\n#### 13.1.4 Marking scales\n\nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.\n\nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.\n\nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.7)\n\n### 13.2 Feedback\n\n#### 13.2.1 Feedback and provisional marks\n\nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student’s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.\n\n##### UCL feedback policy\n\nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.\n\n##### Computer Science feedback policy\n\nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.\n\nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.\n\nThe department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.\n\n##### Computer Science exam script policy\n\nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.\n\n##### Computer Science provisional marks policy\n\nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Section 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-5-assessment-feedback)\n\n### 13.3 Examinations\n\nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.\n\nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.\n\nPlease check the [Students’ webpages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n#### Examination scheduling\n\nExaminations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms.\n\nThe timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows:\n- Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025\n- Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025\n\nThe timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable.\n\n#### Examination conduct\n\nStudents must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments). Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.\n\n- [Exams and assessments | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments)\n- [Assessment Success Guide | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/assessment-success-guide)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2024-25 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n#### Intercollegiate examinations\n\nUCL students taking examinations at other colleges, as part of the University of London’s intercollegiate module sharing scheme, should refer to the Student Policy outlined in the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) (see [Chapter 8, Annex 10: Intercollegiate Module Sharing with other University of London Colleges - Student Policy | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-8-academic-partnerships-framework/annex-8-10-intercollegiate-module-sharing-other)).\n\n#### Computer Science past exam paper policy\n\n[UCL Library Services Digital Exam Papers Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/electronic-resources/exam-papers) hosts a limited collection of past examination papers, which students may use to guide their examination preparation.\n\nThe department's policy is to include a maximum of three past papers in the library service. Papers from the late summer exam period or that include multiple choice questions will not be published. Papers for a particular year are not guaranteed to be made available. Examination papers (and solutions, where they exist) are not to be provided under information access requests.\n\n### 13.4 Coursework\n\nInformation on coursework submissions, clear information about where and how to submit work, including details of any electronic submission methods and the technical support available.\n\nCoursework covers a broad range of assessment methods, including for example: written reports, essays, technical questions, group work, programming tasks, application development, lab work, online MCQs, presentations, practical and demonstrations, and excluding written examinations. In-class tests count as coursework in most respects (for example, UCL's service standards for feedback), but are usually carried out under examination-like conditions.\n\nMost modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.\n\n#### Coursework scheduling\n\nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows:\n- Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.)\n- Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.\n\n#### Coursework submission\n\nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.\n\n#### Support for coursework submission\n\nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the [Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support) via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.\n\nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the [Computer Science Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg) or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.\n\n### 13.5 Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations\n\nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.\n\nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)\n\nHowever, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.\n\nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.\n\n#### Mitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is accepted, the student may be granted an extension. If the deadline has already passed, the late submission may be condoned i.e. there will be no penalty for submitting late.\n\n- [UCL’s Student Support Framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-support-and-wellbeing/student-support-framework)\n\n#### Late penalties & latest permissible submission\n\nWork is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted.\n\nFor assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows:\n\n| Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline)                                                                   | Description of penalty to apply                                                    | Notes                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Less than 2 working days late.                                                                                                                                                     | Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) | Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6.

Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.12: Coursework Deadlines & Late Submission | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.12)\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.6 Penalties for exceeding word count limits\n\nInformation about word count limits and penalties.\n\nAssessment task instructions may include maximum or minimum word counts; these help ensure that student's submit work that is of a suitable level of detail. The instructions will indicate whether footnotes, diagrams, images, tables, figures and bibliographies will factor into the word count, and specify any penalties that will be applied for exceeding the given parameters.\n\nFor project work the department typically specifies maximum page counts rather than word counts, due to the wide variety of kinds of projects. The instructions for each task will be published to the relevant module’s Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. This will include any specific parameters and, where relevant, any consequences for exceeding them.\n\n#### Application of word count penalties\n\nWord count penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without word count penalties applied. Any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners, at which time students will be formally notified by email.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 3.13: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-3-module-assessment#3.13)\n\n### 13.7 Absence from assessments\n\nInformation about absence from scheduled assessments and the consequences of this.\n\nExaminations, tests, practical demonstrations, and oral examinations are examples of scheduled assessments, where the assessment must be undertaken at a fixed date and time.\n\nIf a student is absent from a scheduled assessment without prior permission, then a mark of zero will be given for that component and the student will be considered to have made an attempt, unless they formally request to defer their assessment to a later date by submitting a claim for Extenuating Circumstances with appropriate supporting evidence. If Extenuating Circumstances are not approved, the mark of zero will stand and the student will be considered to have made an attempt.\n\n#### Mitigation for absence via the extenuating circumstances procedure\n\nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico. If the request is approved, the student may be granted a deferral of the attempt to a future occasion.\n\n- [Chapter 2, Section 2: Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-2-student-support-framework/section-2-short-term-illness-and-other-extenuating-circumstances)\n\n### 13.8 Condonement and reassessment (deferrals, resits, repeats)\n\nInformation on the consequences of failure, include reassessment and deferred assessment, capping of module marks, and restrictions on second attempts.\n\nStudents are permitted a maximum of two attempts at any given assessment. If a student fails a module at the first attempt, then they might:\n1.  be eligible for condonement of the failed module (where they meet the requirements for condonement specified for their programme);\n2.  be required to resit failed components of the module;\n3.  be required to repeat the failed module at a future occasion (i.e., in the next academic year;) or\n4.  apply for a deferral or other support under the Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances procedures.\n\n#### Condonement\n\nCondonement allows a student to progress from one year to the next and/ or to be awarded a qualification where they are carrying a small amount of failure, as long as their overall performance is of a good standard and the requirements of any relevant Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Bodies are met.\n\nStudents who meet their programme's condonement criteria will not be reassessed in the condoned modules, which are treated as though they have been passed.\n\nA student’s eligibility for condonement in any given module is determined by the rules of the programme of study on which they are enrolled, since each programme will define which of its modules may or may not be condoned, and any conditions that may apply in addition to the standard regulations.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 6.3: Condonement | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-6-progression-and-award#6.3)\n- [Guide to Undergraduate Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-undergraduate-condonement)\n- [Guide to Postgraduate Taught Condonement | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/provisional-results/guide-postgraduate-taught-condonement)\n- [Section 8: Programme structure | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### Reassessment (resits, repeats)\n\nWhere a student fails one or more modules at the first attempt and is not eligible for condonement, then they will be required to undertake reassessment of the failed modules.\n\nDepending on the amount of failure, how many credits' worth of modules, reassessment may be in the form of a resit or a repeat:\n- Where a student is required to resit a module, they will be reassessed in its failed components at the next occasion, typically in the late summer assessment period.\n- Where a student is required to repeat a module, they will take the module in the next academic year and complete reassessment in all its components.\n- Where a postgraduate taught student fails in their dissertation/ research project, they will normally resit by the end of January. Exceptionally, the Board of Examiners may decide that the extent of failure is such that the student will need to repeat the dissertation with tuition and fees.\n\nArrangements for reassessment of intercollegiate modules taken as part of a UCL programme will be determined by the responsible UCL Board of Examiners.\n\nThe marks for modules in which students have undertaken second attempts will be capped at the module pass mark (40.00% for modules at FHEQ levels 4, 5 and 6; 50.00% for modules at FHEQ level 7.)\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9: Consequences of Failure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.4: Resitting a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.4)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 9.5: Repeating a Module | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-9-consequences-failure#9.5)\n\n#### Deferred assessment\n\nIf an assessment has been affected by Extenuating Circumstances (ECs), at either the first or second attempt, then students may apply for mitigation under the extenuating circumstances procedure. If approved, a student may be offered a deferral of that attempt of the assessment to a future occasion. The deferral is effectively a new first or second attempt. Students may be able to use a Delayed Assessment Permit to defer an assessment, if eligible.\n\nIf a student successfully passes a module having deferred components only at their first attempt, then their module mark will not be capped. If a student successfully passes a module having deferred in any components at their second attempt, then their module mark will be capped at the module pass mark.\n\n- [Illness and unexpected disruptions to your exam or assessment | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/extenuating-circumstances)\n- [Chapter 4, Section 8: Deferred Assessment | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-8-deferred-assessment)\n\n### 13.9 Academic integrity\n\nInformation about UCL’s examination irregularities and plagiarism procedures.\n\n#### Academic standards and integrity\n\nHigh academic standards are fundamental to ensuring continued trust and confidence in UCL’s world-leading research and teaching, as well as the individuals who work and study at UCL. UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL’s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the [UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism). Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.\n\nIn particular, students should familiarise themselves with:\n- the academic integrity guidelines, as set out on the [Current Students - Academic Integrity webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/academic-integrity).\n- the UCL Moodle course '[Introduction to Academic Integrity](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23336)'.\n- examination conduct requirements, as set out in the [UCL Examination Guide for Candidates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments), which is published annually on the Examinations and Awards website.\n- Guidance provided by module examiners in relation to the assessments they set.\n\nIn addition, students are strongly encouraged to clarify with their assessment-setters any requirements that relate to their academic conduct in those assessments, including for example:\n- referencing conventions;\n- opportunities for, or restrictions on, collaboration with others;\n- attribution of contributions in group work; and\n- any requirements to use plagiarism tools prior to submission.\n\nThe vast majority of students at UCL will maintain their academic integrity throughout their studies, but it is important to be aware that UCL may consider breaches to students' academic integrity as an instance of academic misconduct. When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.\n\nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the [Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual) define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)\n\n#### Academic integrity in Computer Science modules\n\nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module:\n- Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.)\n- Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.)\n- Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.\n\nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.\n\nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.\n\n#### Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating\n\nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.\n\nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.\n\nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.\n\n#### Investigating and penalising academic misconduct\n\nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.\n\nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the [Turnitin service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/turnitin/) for written work or [Measure of Software Similarity service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg/services/moss) for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.\n\nWhere academic misconduct is found to have occurred, the department will undertake a formal investigation, which may result in the imposition of penalties. In the event of repeated instances of academic misconduct by a student, the penalty imposed could result in exclusion from UCL or, if a student has graduated, rescindment of their qualification.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 9: Student Academic Misconduct Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-9-student-academic-misconduct-procedure)\n- [Chapter 4: Student Regulations for Exams and Assessments 2022-23 | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/student-regulations-exams-and-assessments)\n\n### 13.10 Research ethics\n\nInformation about research ethics, approvals process, code of conduct, etc. on the programme (where applicable.)\n\nResearch ethics ensures that the rights, dignity and best interests of all parties involved in, or affected by, a student’s research are protected. This often simply means gaining consent from informants and organisations, behaving with empathy in the field, and providing anonymity to people and places during and after the research phase.\n\nAll Computer Science students who undertake research, for example through their final project/ dissertation, must consider the ethical implications of the work they intend to carry out and, where necessary, seek ethical approval for this. Students will receive guidance on research ethics from their Project Supervisor through their project/ dissertation module. Some degrees also cover research ethics through the taught part of the programme. If a student wished to undertake research through their taught modules, for example as part of an assessment, they should seek guidance on any ethical implications from the relevant module leader.\n\n- [UCL Research Ethics | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/integrity/ucl-research-ethics)\n\n### 13.11 Marking, second-marking, and moderation\n\nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.\n\nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.\n\n#### Computer Science marking policies\n\nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.\n\nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.\n\n### 13.12 External examining\n\nInformation about external examining at UCL.\n\nExternal Examiners are senior academics or practitioners from other universities who help UCL to monitor the quality of the education we provide to our students. In particular, External Examiners scrutinise the assessment processes on each programme, helping UCL to ensure that all students have been treated fairly, that academic standards have been upheld and that the qualifications awarded are comparable with similar degrees at other UK universities.\n\nEach external examiner submits an online annual report at the end of the academic year, wherein they reflect on the evidence of teaching and assessment they have observed, the integrity of the department's assessment processes, the standard of students work, and provide any recommendations for improvement or issues of concern. The department, and the faculty, will reflect on external examiners' reports and address any recommendations or issues via a formal response, which is submitted to UCL Academic Services for review. The external examiners' reports and departmental responses will be discussed with Academic Representatives via the Student Partnership Committee, and will be scrutinised by faculty, department and institution-level committees.\n\nStudents can access their external examiner's report and departmental response for their programme through Portico (via 'My Studies', 'Module Assessment’ or ‘Summary of Results and Awards’) or contacting the Computer Science Assessment Team at [cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk). On the same “My Studies” Portico page, students can also access UCL wide External Examiners reports for the last three years. For central queries relating to External Examining, students can contact Student and Registry Services ([examiners@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:examiners@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Chapter 9, Section 4: External Examining | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-4-external-examining)\n\n---\n## 14.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.\n\nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.\n\n#### Assessment information on Moodle\n\nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team ([cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk)).\n\n#### Access to Moodle pages\n\nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.\n\n- [Moodle Resource Centre | UCL Wiki](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/MoodleResourceCentre)\n\n### 14.4 Portico\n\nInformation on Portico – what it is, why it is important and who to contact for support.\n\n[Portico](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/portico/) is the main UCL student information system which is used by both staff and students.

UCL is working to eradicate these issues and seeks to promotes an environment in which they are known to be unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence to raise concerns in the knowledge that they will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.\n\nTo help with this, UCL has [Report and Support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/report-support/), an on-line reporting tool where students can report any issues anonymously or with contact details request to speak to an advisor in order to make an informed decision about their options.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:\n- Intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive behaviour which has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity or creating an intimidating environment.\n- Unwanted conduct related to a protected characteristic that has the purpose or effect of violating a person’s dignity. The unwanted conduct can be physical, verbal, or non-verbal.\n- Unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature such as sexual harassment, invitations, comments, coercion and promised advancement in exchange for sexual access.\n\nIf a student experiences any of these behaviours, they can report it and/ or access support. Students can request to be contacted by an advisor or they can report anonymously. With either option students can give as much or as little detail as they wish.

Internships are not part of a degree programme, are not assessed, and are optional. However, they can provide valuable experience, and give a head start for finding a good job after graduation.\n\nUndergraduate students may undertake an optional internship over the summer period between each year of study, whilst not attending university; this sort of internship is not part of the degree programme and therefore does not contribute to progression or award. The department’s postgraduate taught programmes are 1 year, full-time, and it is therefore not possible to undertake an internship that is not formally part of a programme.\n\n#### Departmental research internships\n\nThe department runs a programme of paid research internships over the summer vacation period (between the end of the summer exam period and the start of the new academic year), where undergraduate students can intern with one of the department's research staff or teams.\n\n#### Industrial placement year ('year in industry')\n\nStudents who wish to take an internship that is formally part of the programme may apply to transfer to a 'Year in Industry' version of their programme, where one exists, to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner. An Additional Placement Year extends the length of the degree by one year and is a formally assessed part of the degree.\n\n#### Industrial collaboration & placements for final projects/ dissertations\n\nStudent projects may have an industrial focus, developed in collaboration with an approved industry partner via the department's [Industry Exchange Network (IXN)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/ixn-industry-exchange-network).

One of the ways they do that is by working with departments and faculties to ensure that every student is represented and has a voice in the way that the university works, which is achieved through their academic representative scheme.\n\nEvery student at UCL will have a Course Representative who will be their eyes, ears, and voice.  They will work closely with staff in the department to make sure that they understand what students most value and take action to deal with things students would like to see improve.  They will also work with Lead Department Representative as well as Faculty Representatives and the Students' Union UCL to make things better across the whole of UCL.\n\n#### Course Representatives\n\nStudents from each degree programme will elect a Course Representative (Course Rep) to represent them.  The Course Representatives will be members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, which is the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency.\n\n#### Lead Departmental Representatives\n\nOnce Course Reps are appointed, two will be appointed as Lead Departmental Representatives (Lead Reps): one for undergraduate programmes and one for postgraduate taught programmes.  The Lead Reps Co-Chair their respective Staff Student Consultative Committees, be members of the Departmental Teaching Committee, which is the department's principal body for academic governance, and liaise between the Students' Union and the Course Representatives.\n\n#### Faculty  Representatives\n\nFaculty Representatives will be appointed as members of the Faculty Staff Student Consultative Committee, will work closely with the Students' Union to identify trends and opportunities for improvement, and raise issues to the Faculty Teaching Committee for discussion.\n\n#### Elections\n\nAcademic Representatives are appointed during early October.  If a student takes up a representative role, the Students' Union will work closely with them to provide training, support, and advice, and they'll be able to change the experience of everyone on their course or in their department for the better.  Even if a student doesn't want to take up a role, they should keep an eye out for a chance to vote for which students they feel will do the best job.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Academic Representatives | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/academic-representatives)\n- [Find your representative | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6: Student Academic Representation | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation)\n\n### 17.4 Departmental Student Partnership Committee\n\nInformation on the role of the Departmental Student Partnership Committee.\n\nEvery department at UCL has a Student Partnership Committee (SPC) that meets at least three times a year.  Student Partnership Committees are meetings where Academic Reps and staff work together to develop solutions to students' concerns, and prioritise areas for improvement.  SPCs are co-chaired by your Lead Department Representative.  Some departments have a single SPC, while others split this into different levels of study.  Most commonly, departments operate both an undergraduate and postgraduate SPC.\n\n- [CS Student Partnership Committees & Academic Representatives | CS Student Intranet](\n- [Chapter 9, Section 6.4: Staff Student Consultative Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-6-student-representation#6.4)\n- [Chapter 9, Section 7: Student Representation on UCL Academic Standing Committees and Sub-Committees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-9-student-support-and-wellbeing-framework/section-7-student-representation-ucl-academic-standing)\n\n### 17.5 Student voice - other ways to feed back\n\nOther ways (specific to the department/ programme) that students can give feedback, including local processes and key contacts.\n\n#### 17.5.1 Staff office hours\n\nEach Programme Director and Module Leader will hold a regular office hour during term time (for modules this will be during the term in which the module is delivered.) These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing.  Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.\n\nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.  The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week.  Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.\n\n- [Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.2 Surveys and questionnaires\n\nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.  These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved.  More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](\n\n#### 17.5.3 Student forum\n\nThe department have implemented a student only forum, hosted on Moodle, where students can discuss issues, without oversight by Academic or Administrative Staff.  Any issues that cannot, or could not, be resolved through direct contact with either a module leader, or programme director, will then be summarised by one of the Academic Representatives, and shared within an Academic forum for resolution.  Once an outcome is confirmed, the Academic Representatives will relay this back to the student only forum.  If further discussion on a given matter is required, a new thread will be created within the Academic forum.\n\n- [Computer Science Student Hub | Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=25380)\n\n### 17.6 Students' Union Advice Service\n\nInformation on the UCL Students' Union Advice Service.\n\nThe [Students' Union Advice Service](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service) is available to all current UCL students, as well as those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme.  Trained and experienced staff are ready to support students with any difficulties that might occur during your time at UCL.  The Advice Service specialises in:\n- Academic Advice - including extenuating circumstances, academic misconduct and the support to study framework\n- UCL Complaints and Disciplinaries\n- Housing Issues - including tenancy contract checks and housemate disputes\n- Employment Rights - including unpaid wages and part time employment contracts\n- Financial Support and Budgeting including income maximisation, money management and hardship funds\n\nThe service is free, independent, impartial and confidential.  No information shared with the service is shared with the students department or any other university staff unless the student requests it or gives their permission.   Students can complete the [online contact form](https://studentsunionucl.org/forms/advice-service-contact-form) for advice and support.\n\n### 17.7 Student complaints\n\nInformation on informal and formal student complaints.\n\nUCL aims to ensure that every student is satisfied with their experience of UCL.  However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided.\n\nBefore raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them.\n\nWhilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance.\n\n#### 17.7.1 Informal resolution\n\nMany complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint.  Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme.  They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.  UCL strongly encourages this kind of resolution and does expect students to have attempted some form of informal resolution before making a formal complaint.\n\n| Route of Escalation | Academic                 | Academic          | Pastoral       | Administrative             |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |\n|                     | Academic Representatives | Module Lead       | Personal Tutor | Teaching and Learning Team |\n|                     |                          | Year Co-ordinator |                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Programme Director|                |                            |\n|                     |                          | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education | Departmental Tutor or Director of Education |\n\nContact details are available as follows:\n- Personal Tutors (who are indicated in each student's Portico record) via the [UCL Directory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/directory/).\n- Programme Leaders via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty - CS Student Handbook](\n- Departmental Tutor and Faculty Tutor via [Section 2: Introduction to the Department and Faculty | CS Student Handbook](\n- Course Representatives via in the [Directory of Academic Reps | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/make-a-change/representation/find-your-representative).\n- Students' Union contacts are available via the [Advice Service | Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/advice-service).\n\nThough we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can.  The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible.\n\n#### 17.7.2 Formal complaints\n\nIf an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure.  UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.  The Complaints Procedure applies across all Schools, Faculties, Academic Departments and Professional Service Divisions.  Students' attention should be drawn to the timescales set out in the Procedure.\n\n- [Chapter 6, Section 8: UCL Student Complaints Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-8-student-complaints-procedure)\n- [Chapter 6, Section 7: UCL Academic Appeals Procedure | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-7-academic-appeals-procedure)\n\n---\n## 18. Student feedback\n\n### 18.1 The role of student feedback\n\nThe importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results.\n\nOur goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making.  We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL.  In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.\n\nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes:\n- The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see [Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook](\n- The student membership on UCL's committees.\n- The student quality review scheme through which students act as reviewers of academic practice across a range of processes and activities.\n- The student experience panel, through which students can participate in focus groups and projects to help bring improvements to UCL activities.\n- The range of student surveys (such as the national student survey, postgraduate experience surveys, new to UCL survey) and per programme/ module student evaluative questionnaires, whose results inform critical review and action planning by the department.\n- The annual student experience review process through which programmes are health-checked with reference to student feedback, demographic and other data, and input from student reviewers.\n\nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.\n\n- [You Shape UCL | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/you-shape-ucl/)\n- [Survey News and Results | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-feedback/survey-news-and-results)\n\n### 18.2 Student surveys\n\nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.\n\nOne of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey.  Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students.  Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.\n\nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.\n\n- [National Student Survey | Office for Students](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/for-students/national-student-survey-nss/)\n- [Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/surveys/postgraduate-taught-experience-survey-ptes)\n\n### 18.3 Module dialogue\n\nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.\n\nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.\n\nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources.  This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results.  Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.\n\n### 18.4 UCL Changemakers\n\nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.\n\n[UCL ChangeMakers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/changemakers/) helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL:\n- Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL.\n- Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff.\n- Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend.\n- There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.\n\nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).\n\n### 18.5 Student Quality Reviewers\n\nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.\n\n[Student Quality Reviewers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/teaching-learning/student-voice-and-feedback/student-quality-reviewers), where UCL students take an in-depth look at different areas of education and provide detailed feedback and analysis from a student perspective.\n\nThrough the Student Quality Reviewer scheme, students can:\n- Act as a member of an Internal Quality Review panel;\n- Take on a role to review new programmes or support enhancements to assessments through the Programme or Assessment Design Student Partner roles;\n- Work with staff to reflect on their teaching through the ChangeMakers Teaching Dialogue scheme;\n- Provide a student view on how teaching can include more diverse perspectives as a Student Curriculum Partner;\n- Students are paid a stipend of £300 for around 25 hours work.\n\n---\n## 19.

Volunteering Services\n\nInformation about the Students' Union UCL Volunteering Services and how to become involved.\n\n### 20.1 About Volunteering Services, who they are and how a student can find out more or become involved\n\nThe [Volunteering Service at Students' Union UCL](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering) exists to connect UCL students with London's Voluntary and Community Sector, primarily through volunteering.  It's one of the largest volunteering teams in UK Higher Education, meaning that UCL students have access to opportunities that their peers in other universities often do not.\n\nThe Service runs three main programmes:\n- Partnerships linking students with volunteering opportunities within their network of around 350 community partners.\n- Student-led Projects supporting students to set up and run their own community projects.\n- Community Research Initiative connecting master's students with community organisations for collaborative research and Knowledge Exchange projects that form their dissertations.\n\nThrough community volunteering, students develop new skills and learn how to enact change in the wider world.  UCL Student volunteers also report positive benefits on their academic study and well-being.\n\nThe Volunteering Service's opportunities can be found on its [online directory](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering-directory), where students can search for roles related to their academic studies, by skills developed or by cause.  There are plenty of one-off and flexible vacancies that students can fit around their studies and other commitments.\n\n## 21. Data protection and intellectual property\n\nInformation on how UCL uses student information, for what purposes, and the steps taken to safeguard this information; where to find information security, intellectual property and email policies; Information on how to enquire or make a related complaint. Where to find information security, intellectual property, and email policies.\n\n### 21.1 Data protection (how UCL uses student information)\n\nUCL uses student information for a range of purposes, including the provision of teaching and learning, managing accommodation and ensuring health and safety. Further information about how UCL uses student information can be found in the [UCL General Student Privacy Notice](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/privacy/general-student-privacy-notice).\n\nStudents may send queries on data protection matters to the University Data Protection Officer ([data-protection@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:data-protection@ucl.ac.uk).)\n\n- [Information Security Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/information-security-policy)\n- [Email Usage Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/email-usage-policy)\n- [Data Protection Policy | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/policy/data-protection-policy)\n- [Understand your intellectual property (IP) rights | UCL Innovation & Enterprise](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/students/support-students-and-alumni/ip-intellectual-property)\n- [Report a Breach of Personal Data | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/report-breach-personal-data)\n\n### 21.2 Storing and securing data\n\nStudents are strongly encouraged to save their work on UCL's file stores, which are backed-up regularly. Storage space is finite, however students can request additional storage space from the [Technical Support Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/tsg), for example where they are required to produce assets with significant file size.\n\nIf students save work to their own devices, they should ensure their files are appropriately backed up to protect against data loss (which is not usually acceptable grounds for Extenuating Circumstances.) The [UCL Dropbox service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/dropbox-ucl) may be used to securely exchange files that may be too large for email or other services.\n\nIf students need to store or exchange sensitive data, then this should be appropriately encrypted. Where data is encrypted, the encryption key should be securely backed up to avoid data loss.\n\n- [Information Security | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/)\n- [File storage & sharing | UCL Information Services Division](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing)\n- [Encryption | UCL Information Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/abcs-information-security/e-encryption)\n\n---\n## 22. Health, safety, and security\n\nInformation on UCL's health, safety and security policies and procedures.\n\n### 22.1 Health, Safety and Security at UCL\n\nUCL's overall objective is to provide and maintain a safe and healthy environment for staff, students, people who work with UCL and those who visit. Health and safety is an integral part of the way in which UCL's activities are managed and conducted.\n\nThere are three departments that work together to provide a comprehensive system to provide the safe and healthy environment:\n- [UCL Security](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl), who cover everything from ID cards and access to our buildings to lost property and keeping people safe who work out of hours;\n- [UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/), who manage the safety management system including providing advice for risk assessments to training people to work with radioactive samples;\n- [UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/) who ensure the buildings and sites are safe, including managing contractors, building works and access to equipment such as defibrillators.\n\n- [Accidents and Emergencies | UCL Estates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/accidents-and-emergencies)\n- [Emergency contacts | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/emergency-contacts)\n- [Staying safe | UCL Students - UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe)\n- [Fire Safety at UCL | UCL Safety Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/safety-services/fire-safety)\n- [Safety on and off campus | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/safety-and-campus)\n- [SafeZone App | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/our-services/security-ucl/safezone-app)\n\n### 22.2 Health and safety at Computer Science\n\nThe policy of the department is to promote the safety, health and welfare of all its staff, students, visitors, contractors and members of the public on the department's premises and to protect them elsewhere from any adverse effect on their health or safety arising from the activities of the Department. The Head of Department is responsible for safety in connection with work done in the Department and in its name. The Departmental Safety Officer is appointed by the Head of Department to assist them in the creation, development, monitoring and review of the department's arrangements for safe working.\n\nThe department's [health and safety webpage](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/internal/safety) describes safety procedures and policies, and lists the responsibilities of staff in relation to first aid, fire evacuation, and emergency situations.\n\n### 22.3 Reporting safety issues in the department\n\nStudents should report any safety issues or concerns to the Departmental Safety Officer as soon as possible. In particular, students should report fire doors that do not close properly, blocked fire exits, misplaced fire extinguishers and any other safety hazards. In the case of urgent safety problems, the assistance of any member of staff should be sought as soon as possible.\n\n---\n## 23.

The statement confirms a student's current enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date and expected programme end date. The statement can be used, for example, by eligible full-time students to apply for council tax exemption and by international students to apply to open a UK bank account.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose proof of student status.)\n\n- [Confirmation of registration and award | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates)\n- [Students and council tax | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money/managing-your-money/council-tax)\n- [Money and finances | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/money)\n\n### 23.4 Confirmation of results and awards (transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award)\n\nInformation on requesting or accessing transcripts, degree certificates, and statements of award.\n\n#### 23.4.1 Transcripts of results\n\nA [transcript](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts) is an official document that details a student's module marks, grades, and any awards.\n\n##### Continuing undergraduate students (i.e., those in years 2 and higher)\n\nStudents may order a free copy of their academic transcript per academic year providing their order is made prior to the end date of their programme. The transcript will only include module results that have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners. This option is not available to students in year 1 (i.e., first year undergraduates and postgraduate taught students), as they will have no confirmed results to include on a transcript.\n\n##### Graduating students (i.e., those having completed their programme and met the requirements for award)\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. The transcript will be sent to their home addresses, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n##### Affiliate students\n\nStudents will be automatically issued with their academic transcript on completion of their study at UCL. For Junior Year Abroad (JYA), Exchange, and Erasmus students, transcripts will be issued to students' home universities; for independent affiliate students, transcripts will be issued to students' registered contact addresses.\n\nUCL Student Records can produce additional transcripts for students on taught programmes (including affiliate students) via the [UCL Transcript Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/transcripts).\n\n#### 23.4.2 Degree certificates\n\nA [degree certificate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/degree-certificates) is the official certificate of an award of a qualification, including any classification, that has been conferred by UCL.\n\nGraduating students, which includes all students who are conferred a UCL qualification, will be automatically issued with their degree certificate within three months of the date their award is conferred by UCL Education Committee. Degree certificates will be sent to the home address, as held on Portico, and so should be kept up to date.\n\n- [Chapter 4, Section 12: Award of Degrees | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-4-assessment-framework-taught-programmes/section-12-award-degrees)\n\n#### 23.4.3 Statements of award\n\nA statement of award is an official letter that can used as proof of an award conferred by UCL. The statement confirms a student's enrolment status, mode of attendance (full, part-time), programme of study, programme start date, programme end date, award conferred, and any classification conferred.\n\nStudents can print their own statement via Portico or can request one via [askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl) (log an enquiry and choose statement of award.)\n\n### 23.5 Confirmation of academic and non-academic record (Higher Education Achievement Report)\n\nInformation about the undergraduate Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR.)\n\nA [Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/student-status/transcripts-and-certificates/higher-education-achievement-report-hear) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL.\n\nNew students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, [Gradintel](https://gradintel.com/).\n\nEach summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account.\n\n### 23.6 Academic references\n\nInformation on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study.\n\nAn academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The [Student Reference Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-14-student-support-and-wellbeing/student-reference-policy), which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references.\n\nWhere a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines.\n\nStudents should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year.\n\n### 23.7 Graduation ceremonies\n\nInformation on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies.\n\nA [graduation ceremony](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/graduation/) is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification.\n\nEach year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.)\n\nIn order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably:\n- undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year;\n- attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date.\n\nOnce invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)\n\n### 23.8 UCL Alumni community\n\nInformation on UCL and Computer Science alumni activities.\n\nAn alumnus (plural alumni) is a term for someone who has attended or graduated from a particular institution.\n\nAs UCL alumni, students join a global community of over 350,000 former students. All [UCL alumni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/) can take advantage of a huge range of exclusive benefits and support, including access to thousands of e-journals, use of the library, a UCL-branded email for life and UCL Careers services for up to three years. Alumni can stay connected through reunions, international networks, and interest-based groups. UCL students and alumni can also take advantage of UCL's lifelong learning opportunities through UCL Connect, our professional development programme of panel events, workshops, and resources such as blogs, case studies and podcasts.\n\n- [Services for Alumni | UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/alumni/services-alumni)\n- [Alumni of the department | UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/alumni)\n\n---\n## 24. Keeping in touch\n\nDetails of how UCL and the department will communicate with students through their studies.\n\n### 24.1 Central and Faculty communication channels\n\nWe will communicate with students primarily through the following channels:\n\n| Channel           | Descriptor                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| UCL student email | Students have a UCL email account (via Microsoft Office365), which is the primary channel through which the department and wider university will communicate with students. Students should check their email regularly.          |\n| Moodle            | UCL's online learning space, used by module organisers, programme leaders, departments and faculties to provide essential information in addition to learning resources. Each module's Moodle page has a forum that is used by staff to communicate updates. |\n| myUCL             | A weekly term-time e-newsletter to all students (undergraduate and postgraduate) at UCL, which covers key internal announcements, events and opportunities.                                                                    |\n| Instagram         | UCL's official Instagram channel, featuring news, events, competitions and images from across the UCL community.                                                                                                                   |\n| X                 | Sharing highlights of life at UCL from across UCL's diverse community.                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n### 24.2 Computer Science communications\n\n#### 24.2.1 Email, Moodle, and Teams\n\nStudents will receive the vast majority of important correspondence via their UCL email account and through their modules' Moodle pages (in particular via the forums, where teaching staff and assistants will post updates and information about the module.) The CS Teaching and Learning Team will always contact students via their UCL email account.\n\nStudents should check their UCL email account on a regular basis. Important instructions, including those regarding module registration, assessment, and other essential Departmental and UCL information, will be circulated via email. It is the students own responsibility to ensure they check their email account regularly and respond to messages as appropriate by any deadline given.\n\n##### Mailing lists\n\nStudents will be registered onto several mailing lists, including: programme and year of study; level of study (all undergraduates, all taught postgraduates); and per module. Access to sending to these lists is restricted to key staff in order ensure students do not receive the same message multiple times. However, there will always be some emails that do not apply to all students and some overlap in communications.\n\n##### Teams, Zoom, and other app-based channels\n\nConnected delivery will make use of a range of applications, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Students should not contact staff via one-to-one direct messaging unless that member of staff has specifically indicated otherwise. By default, queries about module-specific matters (for example, guidance on materials or assessment) should be posted to the module's Moodle forum; this ensures that all students on the module can benefit both from the question and the answer, enables TAs and other staff on the module to access/ respond to queries, and avoids the risk of missed messages going unanswered.\n\n##### Access and technical support\n\nAccess to email and other UCL services depends on having a working UCL account. Current UCL policy requires passwords to be changed regularly and students need to pay attention to this. The ISD Helpdesk can provide support for account related issues.\n\n#### 24.2.2 Social media\n\nComputer Science is active on the following social media channels:\n- [Computer Science X](https://twitter.com/uclcs) – the department's official X channel.\n- [Computer Science YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-p1t00I9v6-82BFlR_9tqg) –the department's YouTube channel.\n- [Computer Science LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ucl-computer-science/) – the department's LinkedIn page.\n\n- [UCL Code of Conduct for Students | UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual/chapters/chapter-6-student-casework-framework/section-10-student-code-conduct)\n- [How to stay safe when networking online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/how-stay-safe-when-networking-online)\n- [Fraud and scams - Staying safe online | UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/life-ucl/staying-safe/fraud-and-scams-staying-safe-online)\n\n##### Teaching and Learning Team Drop-in Sessions\n\nThe Teaching and Learning team run a virtual drop-in session for student queries. The session runs in Teams. Although you do not need an appointment, you may need to wait if another student is already in the session. We encourage use of the drop-in, as it is often a quicker way of resolving a query than over email.\n\n##### Schedule\n\n- Term-time, Wednesday 10am to 11am (UK time) ( This session is for MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students only)\n- Term-time, Thursday 11am to 12pm (UK time)\n\nYou can join the drop-in using one of the buttons below. Please ensure you join the session appropriate to your programme of study.\n\nWe operate a lobby-based queue system. You will remain in the queue until a member of the Teaching and Learning team is free to talk. When your conversation has concluded, we will ask you to exit the meeting so we can invite the next student in.\n\nPlease have your Student ID ready when you join the drop-in. This helps us be more efficient in responding to your enquiry.\n\nYou will only be able to speak to a staff member via the below links when the meetings are live.\n\n##### Important:\n\nThere will be no Thursday drop-ins on 13 February, 20 March, and 10 April.\n\n##### Personal Tutor Office Hours\n\nYour Personal Tutor should contact you at the start of term and should indicate to you their preferences for how best to contact them and organise a meeting. If you have not yet been contacted by your Personal Tutor, then please let the Departmental Tutor know via email ([b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:b.oldfrey@ucl.ac.uk))\n\n##### Programme Director and Year Coordinator Office Hours\n\nProgramme Directors (or Deputy Programme Directors) and Academic Year Coordinators hold regular Office Hours.\n\n##### Undergraduate programmes (2)\n\nOffice Hours for undergraduate programmes are as follows:\n\n| Staff | Role | Day of the week | Times (24hr clock, UK time) | Mode (online/on- campus) | Location (on- campus) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ivana Drobnjak](https://search2.ucl.ac.uk/s/search.html?query=Ivana+Drobnjak&collection=website-meta&profile=_directory&tab=directory) | BSc/ MEng Computer Science | Thursday | 5pm -

      "1.2 Head of Department's welcome Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science. Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world. It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country. One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you. So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being. I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.

Introduction to the department and faculty An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both. ### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research. In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent. Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond. ###"

      "2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes. UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work. Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques. Though diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world. ###"
