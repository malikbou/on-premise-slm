Modules Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.) Compulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests. Module availability Modules for Computer Science students The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages.

New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment. Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible. Module selection | UCL Students Approval of selections Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process. Change of selections Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader. Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico. Verification of selections Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.) Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students) Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.

Students are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.)

If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module. All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action. Section 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual Section 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual Module information Information about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity. A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study. Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme."

      "Module timetable Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study. Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other. Students selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week. Key contacts for module selection Contacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise. Academic advice on module selection For academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor. Students intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department. Academic advice on specific modules For advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.

A Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) is an electronic transcript of a student's verified academic results and approved nonacademic achievements whilst at UCL. New students will be invited to register for the HEAR service during their first year of study, and students who commenced their studies in or after September 2011 will have a HEAR made available to them online, via our HEAR provider, Gradintel. Each summer, students' reports will then be made available to them online via Gradintel. Students can then share their HEARs, free of charge, as a secure electronic token with third parties via their Gradintel account. Academic references Information on requesting academic references in support of applications for job or further study. An academic reference is a statement by a member of UCL's academic staff in relation to a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/ or in relation to their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. The Student Reference Policy, which sets out guidance for staff on compiling references, is a useful indicator for students on how the university manages requests for references. Where a student requires a reference, they should contact the referee as far in advance as possible and provide them with any relevant information about the purpose of the reference (e.g. for job/ internship applications: the role and person specification, a link to company website; for degree applications: the programme description/ details of area of research, a link to provider website) and any deadlines. Students should be aware that (1) references will usually only be possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners; and (2) reference requests may take several weeks to respond to, particularly at busy times of year. Graduation ceremonies Information on attending UCL's graduation ceremonies. A graduation ceremony is an event that is held to celebrate the achievement of students who have been conferred a UCL qualification. Each year, UCL holds a series of graduation ceremonies to celebrate students who have been conferred the award of degree in that academic year. These events usually include speeches, farewell messages, and ceremonial awarding of degree certificates to successful students (i.e. wearing academic robes and 'crossing the stage'.) In order to be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony in a given year, a student's award must be conferred by a deadline date set by UCL Academic Services. If a student's award has not been conferred by that date - for example if they have deferred assessment and their final results will therefore not be available by the cut-off - then they may be invited to a ceremony in the next year. Notably: - undergraduate students who transfer to a Bachelors programme after 1 April can only attend a graduation ceremony in the following year; - attendance to a graduation ceremony will not be permitted unless all tuition fees have been settled by the due date. Once invited to a ceremony, students will be given a deadline by which to confirm their attendance, which will require a ticket for themselves any invited guests. (Note that conferral of an award and issuance of a degree certificate and final transcript is automatic and irrespective of whether or when a student attends a graduation ceremony.)"

Each Hall has a designated Warden supported by a number of live-in Student Residence Advisers (SRA) to provide support for students and to foster a positive environment within the accommodation. Accommodation | UCL Students Financial support The UCL Student Funding Office provides a central service aimed at supporting students with money matters. We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers. Support for financial issues | UCL Students Student of Concern There are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form. Depending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe. Support for raising concerns about a student | UCL Students Other sources of support Information about registering with a doctor and out-of-hours support services. Registering with a doctor Students are strongly encouraged to register with a doctor as soon as possible after they arrive in London so that they can access healthcare quickly if they become ill or injured. When attending a university in the UK students under the age of 25 are also advised to be vaccinated against meningitis (ACWY). The Ridgmount Practice is a National Health Service (NHS) practice providing healthcare for students living within its catchment area (i.e. near the main UCL campus). Students can also choose to register with a practice closer to where they live if they prefer. The Ridgmount Practice also runs a walk-in surgery which any UCL student can attend, even if they are not registered with the practice. Counselling, support and information helpline As part of a partnership with an organisation external to UCL, we provide an information and counselling helpline.

      "Assessment and feedback Information on examination and assessment, including details of the information students will receive, how work is set and marked, and when they will receive notification of their marks. Assessment Overview of assessment All taught degree programmes are formed of modules, individual credit-bearing units of study that each have a defined syllabus (academic content), a set of intended learning outcomes (statements of what a student will be able to do on successful completion of the module), and a set of assessments that collectively develop students’ knowledge and understanding of the syllabus and measures their attainment against the intended learning outcomes. A variety of assessment methods are used across a programme to test different knowledge and skills; these typically include, for example, written examinations, coursework (presentations, reports, practical assessments, tests, group work, etc.), and a research projects/ dissertation. Assessments can be either formative or summative. A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module. A student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module. Assessment structure Each module has one or more summative components of assessment, each of which has a method (its type: coursework, examination, etc.), a title that differentiates and describes it (e.g., Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Individual report, Online remote examination), and a numeric weight that represents its contribution to the module outcome (i.e., how much the mark or grade for that component counts towards the overall mark or grade for the module.) This set of summative assessments is known as the module's 'assessment pattern'. An example assessment pattern for a module: # Method (or type) Title Weight (%) 1 Coursework Coursework 1 15 2 Coursework Coursework 2 25 3 Open book examination Online remote examination 60 Each module's intended assessment pattern is detailed in the UCL Module Catalogue. In some cases, the actual assessment pattern may differ from the intended pattern indicated in the catalogue; this occurs where a late change to the module's assessments has been approved, after the publication of the catalogue. Where such changes are made, the Module leader will notify students on the module at the start of teaching. For Computer Science modules, the final assessment pattern will be indicated in the module's Moodle page, under the 'Assessment' section. Students who need to undertake a reassessment in the late summer assessment period may be set reassessments of alternative methods to the original tasks; this occurs where the original method is not feasible in the late summer assessment period. If a student needs to take reassessments, they will be notified of the details before the reassessment period. Chapter 4, Section 3: Module Assessment | UCL Academic Manual"

      "Assessment tasks and their deadlines Information on how students will learn about the requirements of the assessment tasks they will take, what is required of them. Each summative component of assessment will be assessed by means of an assessment task, which is the specific examination paper, quiz, essay question, coursework, or activity that students are asked to undertake. An assessment task will include instructions on completing the task, what deliverables are required (i.e. what students must do or submit), instructions on whether work should be completed individually or in a group, and marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total, for any parts, and what students' work should demonstrate to be awarded the marks. Deliverables An assessment task may require students to submit one or more 'deliverables', which are linked parts of a task that are submitted separately. For example, an app-based assessment task that requires students to produce working code and document their design process could require students submit (1) a written report; (2) source code; and (3) system output logs as separate deliverables. Where a component comprises multiple submitted deliverables (as per the above example), then they should have the same deadline date and time. The submission is complete when all its deliverables have been submitted (and the submission date and time for the component is taken to be that of the last submitted deliverable.) Individual and group work An assessment task may require students work individually or in groups (or both, i.e., with some parts completed individually and others as a group.) Some tasks may give students the choice of working on their own or as part of a group or may give students the option of collaborating but with some cap on the marks available (e.g., a student may collaborate on the task, but the final mark will be capped at 80%.) Often, modules that include group work will either also include individual components or will include some aspect of peer assessment in the group work itself, which enables the contribution of individuals to be factored into their mark or outcome for the task. The task instructions will specify whether students must or may work in groups and any other parameters relating to collaboration or peer assessment. Engagement in group assessment activity All members of a group or team are expected to make an appropriate and commensurate contribution, which includes communicating with their team, attending team meetings, taking on agreed responsibilities, and contributing to decision making and group deliverables. Any groups experiencing minimal or non-engagement by a group member must report this to the Module leader as soon as possible. Likewise, if a student is part of a group and is experiencing difficulties, then they must contact the Module leader as early as possible to discuss the situation. Under no circumstances may a group unilaterally reorganise its membership or deny any member the opportunity to contribute appropriately. Where upheld, minimal or non-engagement in group-based work by an individual member, where no approved extenuating circumstances apply, may result in that individual being given a reduced mark or a mark of zero. Note that such action requires timely report of issues and may not be possible once marks have been published."

In this way, students who successfully pass the module can be said to have achieved its learning outcomes. A module's intended learning outcomes are stated in the UCL Module Catalogue. Marking criteria Each task will have marking criteria that specifies how many marks are available in total for the assessment task, for any parts or deliverables, and what students' work should demonstrate in order to be awarded the marks available. Marking criteria for group work will also include information on whether and how the contribution of individuals will be assessed and how many peer assessment will be carried out. Summative assessments are criterion-referenced, which means that the assessment evaluates the 'absolute' quality of candidates' work against the marking criteria. This means that the same work should receive the mark or grade, irrespective of the performance of other students in the cohort. Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.

Some components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark. Some components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.

      "UCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

Please check the Students’ webpages for the most up-to-date information. Examination scheduling Examinations may be centrally or departmentally managed. The distinction for students is that centrally-managed examinations will take place in UCL's main examination periods (i.e. in the summer and late summer), whereas departmentally-managed exams (also referred to as tests) can additionally fall in teaching terms. The timetables for centrally-managed exams will be published as follows: - Main summer exam period: 14 March 2025 - Late summer assessment period: 24 July 2025 The timetables for departmentally-managed exams will be notified to students by the relevant teaching department as those assessments are scheduled. Students should expect that departmental in-class or remote online tests for Computer Science modules will be added to the module's timetable. Examination conduct Students must ensure they are aware of the regulations governing examinations detailed in the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates. Students should make sure they review and understand the guidance in advance of the examination period and should direct any questions either to their Personal Tutor or Programme Director.

If a department cannot meet this deadline, they must inform students of the new feedback date, which should not exceed an additional week. For Computer Science taught modules, the department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment or submission deadline, excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays. Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research project or dissertation modules, feedback on a draft version is aimed to be provided within 10 working days, provided the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline.

      "Coursework scheduling Coursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: - Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) - Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.) Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section. Coursework submission Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere. Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline. Support for coursework submission Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience. Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies. Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time. Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.) However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies. The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible."

UCL’s Student Support Framework Late penalties & latest permissible submission Work is late if it is submitted after the published deadline or any extended deadline granted via the extenuating circumstances procedure or via a reasonable adjustment. Penalties will be applied for late work unless retrospective mitigation is granted (for example, condoned late submission or expungement of an attempt.) The penalty that will apply will relate to how late the work is submitted. For assessable work that is submitted prior to the release of solutions, penalties will be applied as follows: Extent of the late submission (how late is the submission in relation to the deadline or any extended deadline) Description of penalty to apply Notes Less than 2 working days late. Component mark reduced by 10.00% points (to no lower than the module pass mark.) Module pass mark is 40.00 for modules at FHEQ levels 4-6. Module pass mark is 50.00 for modules at FHEQ level 7. 2 to 5 working days (inclusive) late. Component mark capped at the module pass mark. Greater than 5 working days late and within one calendar month of the published deadline, or two weeks before the Board of Examiners (whichever is the earlier.) Component mark of 1.00%. Work will not be fully marked and no feedback will be provided. Greater than one month after the published deadline, or less than two weeks before the Board of Examiners. Component mark of zero. Work will not be marked and no feedback will be provided. Work submitted after solutions for an assessment have been released or that is deemed as not assessable will be given a mark of zero, irrespective of the extent of late submission. Application of late penalties Late penalties may not be applied immediately, particularly for work that is subject to automated marking. Markers may mark students' work and release unconfirmed provisional marks via Moodle Gradebook without late penalties applied. Students will be formally notified by email that a penalty has been recorded. Marks in Moodle will remain without penalty, as any penalties due will be applied by the Teaching and Learning Team prior to their confirmation by Board of Examiners.

      "<1-hop>\n\nModule timetable Students can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study. Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.

      "<2-hop>\n\nModule information & selection\n\nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.\n\nModules\n\nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)\n\nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.\n\nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.\n\nModule availability\n\nModules for Computer Science students\n\nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.\n\nModules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)\n\nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)\n\nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.\n\nComputer Science | Study Abroad at UCL\n\nModule registration for affiliates | UCL Students\n\nModule selection\n\nChoosing modules for 2024-25\n\nStudents needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment.\n\nStudents must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible.\n\nModule selection | UCL Students\n\nApproval of selections\n\nStudents can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process.\n\nChange of selections\n\nStudents wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader.\n\nExact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico.\n\nVerification of selections\n\nOnce the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.)\n\nChoosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students)\n\nContinuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.\n\nPortico | UCL\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nContinuing Student Module Registration | UCL Students\n\nAvailability and allocation of places\n\nEach module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.\n\nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.\n\nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.\n\nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.\n\nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module\n\nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.\n\nStudents who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.\n\nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual\n\nSection 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual\n\nModule information\n\nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.\n\nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.\n\nModule catalogue\n\nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection.\n\nThe UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico.\n\nModule deliveries\n\nA module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study.\n\nNotably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students. Where a programme's optional or elective modules show both U and P deliveries, students must only select the version appropriate to their programme.\n\nModule timetable\n\nStudents can view module timetables via the UCL Common Timetable, which can be used to generate timetables for individual modules, groups of modules, or for all compulsory and optional modules on a programme/ year of study.\n\nProgramme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash.

Modules Modules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.) Compulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests. Module availability Modules for Computer Science students The programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups. Modules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students) Ancillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director. Modules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange) Affiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions. Computer Science | Study Abroad at UCL Module registration for affiliates | UCL Students Module selection Choosing modules for 2024-25 Students needing to select optional or elective modules, will be able to do so from before the start of the academic year. New students can register for modules once they have completed pre-enrolment. Continuing students can register for modules once they have completed re-enrolment. Students must complete module registration by no later than 11 October 2024, however they are strongly encouraged to complete the process as early as possible. Module selection | UCL Students Approval of selections Students can check the approval status of their module selections in the 'My Modules' area on Portico. Decisions will be notified by email when selections are either approved or declined. Where a selection is rejected, students will be informed of the reason for this and asked to select an appropriate alternative module from the programme diet, subject to the usual requisite conditions and approval process. Change of selections Students wishing to change a module selection, must make a request to their home department in the first instance. Any change will be subject to the same requisites, orders of priority, and restrictions as an initial selection and must be approved by the Programme Director and the Module Leader. Exact deadlines for making changes to module selections will be published each year in the 'Module Selection Task' on Portico. Verification of selections Once the module selection process has been completed, students will be asked to check and confirm their final module selections, after any changes they have requested, are complete and correct. This is an important step that helps us ensure the students academic record is aligned with their studies, that we enter the student for the correct assessments, and that the level and volume of credit selected is appropriate for their programme of study (and its award requirements.) Choosing modules for 2025-26 (continuing students) Continuing undergraduate students and postgraduate students on programmes of more than 1 year's duration will have an opportunity to make an initial selection of modules for 2025/26 at the end of the spring term, with places being confirmed in the summer.

      "<2-hop>\n\nIntroduction and welcome Welcome messages from UCL's President and Provost and the Computer Science Head of Department, information about the scope and purpose of the Student Handbook, and general advice about changes to information through the year. Provost's welcome Dear students, A warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back. Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future. We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL's research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges. I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience. This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary. UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost Head of Department's welcome Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science. Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world. It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country. One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you. So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being. I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year. Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department"

Unless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section. Coursework submission Procedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere. Students are responsible for ensuring they submit their work by the deadline. Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline. Support for coursework submission Technical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience. Support for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies. Penalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations Coursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time. Planning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.) However, to support you in being autonomous learners and balance the challenges of study, life, and your wellbeing, UCL has introduced the Delayed Assessment Scheme. The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies. The Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.",

      "<2-hop>\n\nThe Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them. UCL's Student Support Framework The Framework includes the following components: Part 1: How to Use this Framework Helps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes: - Where to find help and advice - Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student) - Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data - Information on providing supporting evidence - Links to other support options that are available to students. Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works: Support process Use this if What this covers Delayed Assessment Scheme You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC's. Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence. 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition. UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a 'SoRA' (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL's Student Support and Wellbeing team. Academic Adjustments You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following: You or your partner is pregnant or planning maternity, paternity or adoption leave; You are a parent or carer; You observe religious beliefs or cultural customs; You are affected by any form of harassment or discrimination; You are affected by traumatic world events such as war or terrorism; You are a critical worker (e.g. NHS staff). Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need additional support with learning, teaching and assessment Exam Adjustments You need additional support to sit an online or face-to- face exam. Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take-Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. Interruption of Study You are thinking of taking time out from your studies. Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. Support to Study You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL's other support processes are not providing the right level of help. Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer-term difficulties and UCL's normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support.

      "<1-hop>\n\nStudent feedback The role of student feedback The importance of feedback and how UCL uses the results. Our goal is to put students' feedback, insights and contributions at the heart of decision-making. We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments. The framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook. Other opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor. You Shape UCL | UCL Survey News and Results | UCL Student surveys Student surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey. One of the principal ways in which UCL gathers and responds to student feedback is via online student experience surveys such as the National Student Survey, annual programme evaluations and the New to UCL survey. Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw. Every piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence. National Student Survey | Office for Students Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE Module dialogue Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important. Throughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis. These pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.",

However, we recognise that from time-to-time problems do arise and students may wish to express concern or dissatisfaction with aspects of UCL or the quality of services provided. Before raising a complaint, Computer Science encourages students to ensure they have fully explored all options and avenues for discussion available to them. Whilst students do not need to strictly follow the route of escalation indicated below, many issues, and the need to escalate, can be avoided by speaking to the right people in the first instance. Informal resolution Many complaints can be resolved at an informal or local level without needing to submit a formal complaint. Students can speak to their Personal Tutor, Programme Leader, Departmental or Faculty Tutor, Course Representative, or Research Student Representative if they have any concerns about their programme. They can also speak to the Students' Union's Advice Service.

Though we appreciate that it can sometimes feel difficult to raise concerns (particularly about other people), we strongly encourage any students who are experiencing difficulties, unwanted conduct, or other issues, to raise them to an appropriate person as soon as they can. The department's leadership is committed to treating students' concerns seriously and taking any action as expeditiously as possible. Formal complaints If an issue cannot be resolved at a local level, students may feel they need to submit a formal complaint using UCL's Student Complaints Procedure. UCL aims to ensure that all complaints are treated fairly, impartially, effectively and in a timely manner, without fear of victimisation.

    "reference_contexts": [
      "<1-hop>\n\nUCL feedback policy It is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker’s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts. If, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director. Computer Science feedback policy For taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later. For research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline. The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative. Computer Science exam script policy UCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations. Computer Science provisional marks policy UCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.

Students are responsible for organising and planning their personal study and for ensuring they give themselves sufficient time to meet their assessment deadlines. If a student experiences difficulty with workload planning or achieving their assessment deadlines, we strongly encourage them to proactively seek advice from their Personal Tutor. Attendance and engagement Information on attendance requirements, how student's attendance and engagement is monitored, and penalties for poor attendance (Centrally Provided.) Attendance requirements UCL expects students to attend all the scheduled learning events which appear on their timetable as this gives students the best chance of academic success. This includes all events set out in the programme handbook or those provided to students during a module, including personal tutorials. The Engagement policy is available via the student intranet, and students should ensure they understand the policy, and the consequences of non-adherence: CS Student Engagement Policy for 2024-25. Each Faculty sets minimum attendance requirements for its programmes, which are set out in the UCL Student Attendance Policy. Students should familiarise themselves with the policy and any specific attendance requirements that apply to their programme or modules. Students must ensure they engage with any requirements in place for recording their attendance at scheduled events (e.g., by using their UCL Student ID to scan in into events that takes place in rooms equipped with card-readers and accessing online teaching sessions using their UCL credentials.) Students should also familiarise themselves with the departmental guidance on Engagement and Attendance, so they are aware of the support available to them, and the process to follow if they are absent. Students encountering issues with attendance are advised to contact the respective programme administration team as soon as possible.

Provost's welcome Dear students, A warm welcome to those of you who are new and congratulations on making UCL your university of choice. To those of you returning, welcome back. Your UCL education will take you deep into your chosen field and give you its broader context in our rich multidisciplinary academic culture. It will help you develop skills and networks to prepare you for your future. We want you to learn how to think, not what to think, through UCL's research-based approach to education. Our students are our partners and contributors, working alongside world-leading academic staff to pursue excellence, break boundaries and make an impact on global challenges. I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience. This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL's history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL's bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary. UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible. Dr Michael Spence UCL President and Provost Head of Department's welcome Welcome to UCL's Department of Computer Science. Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world. It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country. One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you. So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being. I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year. Prof. Daniel Alexander Head of Department",

If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module. All module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director. Overlapping content & re-registering on the same module Students must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once. Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.

A module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience. Module catalogue Students can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection. The UCL Module Catalogue shows module syllabuses for the current academic year from September until after the summer exam period, at which point the catalogue will roll forward to show syllabuses for the next academic year. Continuing students can access prior versions of module syllabuses via Portico. Module deliveries A module may have multiple deliveries (or versions.) For example, a module have a term 1 delivery and a term 2 delivery, an undergraduate delivery and a postgraduate delivery, an FHEQ Level 6 delivery, and an FHEQ Level 7 delivery. The UCL Module Catalogue entry will show all available deliveries of a module, however students will be enrolled on the delivery that is appropriate for their programme of study. Notably, a delivery with the code 'U' (e.g. A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U) is available only to undergraduate students and a delivery with code 'P' (e.g. A7P, A8P) is available only to postgraduate students.

The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them. UCL's Student Support Framework The Framework includes the following components: Part 1: How to Use this Framework Helps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes: - Where to find help and advice - Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student) - Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data - Information on providing supporting evidence - Links to other support options that are available to students. Part 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works: Support process Use this if What this covers Delayed Assessment Scheme You need a small amount of flexibility to help you manage your wellbeing, student life, and workload due to reasons which are not grounds for evidenced EC's. Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence. 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition. UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a 'SoRA' (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL's Student Support and Wellbeing team. Academic Adjustments You need long-term or ongoing support with one or more of the following: You or your partner is pregnant or planning maternity, paternity or adoption leave; You are a parent or carer; You observe religious beliefs or cultural customs; You are affected by any form of harassment or discrimination; You are affected by traumatic world events such as war or terrorism; You are a critical worker (e.g. NHS staff). Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need additional support with learning, teaching and assessment",

Academic Adjustments include long-term reasonable adjustments arranged by your Department if you need additional support with learning, teaching and assessment Exam Adjustments You need additional support to sit an online or face-to- face exam. Exam Adjustments are specifically for Controlled Condition Exams and Take-Home Papers, and include adjustments such as extra time, rest breaks, a more comfortable chair and specialist equipment. These are available to students with a longer-term disability or health condition, and to students who need shorter-term support e.g. if you are pregnant, or have a broken arm. Interruption of Study You are thinking of taking time out from your studies. Interruption of Study is for students who wish to take a break from their studies and return at a later date. You can take time out from your studies for a wide range of reasons - you might want to take up an internship or placement, take time out to travel, be planning to have children, or be facing personal challenges which are making it hard to study. Support to Study You are having persistent or ongoing difficulties and UCL's other support processes are not providing the right level of help. Support to Study aims to help you if you are having significant, persistent, longer-term difficulties and UCL's normal mechanisms (e.g. Reasonable Adjustments, Extenuating Circumstances, Interruption of Study) are not providing enough support. We will work with you to put together a Support Plan to help you get the most out of your studies. The Student Support Framework is just one of the ways in which UCL helps students to get the most out of their time with us: The Student Support Framework",

    "reference": "UCL places great importance on student feedback, using it as a central element in decision-making to improve education and student experience. For example, student feedback has led to practical changes such as opening the Library during the Christmas closure period, increasing study spaces including 1000 seats in the 24-hour Student Centre, focusing more on environmental sustainability, and providing clearer information about exams and assessments. Feedback is gathered through various channels including student representative schemes, module leader dialogues, departmental student voice platforms, and online surveys like the National Student Survey and New to UCL survey. All feedback is read and shared with staff across UCL, including senior leadership.\n\nWithin the Student Support Framework, a Personal Tutor plays a key role in helping students get the most out of their studies by providing support and encouragement. They assist students in understanding and accessing formal support options such as extensions or reasonable adjustments. For issues like Extenuating Circumstances—which cover sudden, unexpected, and significantly disruptive events such as serious illness or bereavement—students can submit claims to receive mitigation like assessment extensions or deferrals. The Personal Tutor, along with departmental staff, can guide students on how to navigate these support processes, ensuring they know where to find help and how to provide necessary evidence. Contact details for support staff are available on Moodle or in the Student Handbook, and additional confidential advice is offered by UCL's wellbeing and Students' Union services.",
