I warmly encourage you to shape your journey at UCL. Take our university-wide surveys and work in partnership with academics to make your programme of study even better. Each programme also has opportunities for you to volunteer as an academic representative to work closely with your department to improve the student experience.

This is an exciting time to make your voice heard, with UCL East, the biggest development in UCL’s history, welcoming its second cohort of students and work continuing on implementing our 2022-2027 strategic plan for education. Preparations are also in train on marking UCL’s bicentennial in 2026, with our student partners involved in planning an inspiring programme of events to celebrate this landmark anniversary.

UCL is a community of great minds. You are a valuable member of that community. I hope you will take every opportunity to shape your time with us, so that your experience is the best possible.

Dr Michael Spence
UCL President and Provost

### 1.2 Head of Department's welcome

Welcome to UCL’s Department of Computer Science.

Our discipline is set to produce the biggest technological advances of this century. It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.

It starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.

One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.

So I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.

I am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.

Prof. Daniel Alexander
Head of Department

### 1.3 Teaching and Learning Team welcome

A warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students.

We are very excited to have you with us this year and we're looking forward to supporting you through your time with us. We hope this handbook will serve as a useful companion on your academic journey: it sets out key contacts in the department, and the wide array of academic, pastoral, and welfare support options available to you as a UCL student. It also includes the broad framework of rules and regulations that govern our degrees.

In addition to the handbook, your programme has a dedicated member of the Teaching and Learning Team who can advise you on a whole host of issues and can connect you with the best source of support. You will have met your Teaching and Learning Administrator during induction week, and you can find their details on the [Teaching and Learning contact page](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/PPL--Contacts.aspx).

You have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet, which is a live space where you'll be able to connect with news, events, and current goings on around the department and faculty. The intranet will grow and evolve further as we better understand your needs, and we will work with you through your Student Representatives to get your input and make this a useful resource for all our students.

A key contact for you during your time studying at UCL is your Student Representative. They are a fellow student on your degree programme and are there to present the views of your cohort. Through discussion and collaboration with staff in the department they aim to make your experience the best it can be. Find out more about them via the [Student Reps page](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/CSCStudentIntranet/SitePages/SV--Student-Reps.aspx).

You can get in touch with us via email, drop-in to one of our regular online sessions, or make an appointment for a face-to-face chat. However you choose to reach out, the team is here to support you throughout your time with us.

Best wishes for the year ahead.

Lewis Griffin & Jo Stiles
Departmental Tutor, Teaching & Learning Manager

### 1.4 About the Student Handbook

The Computer Science Student Handbook is intended to provide you with key information regarding the Department of Computer Science and its taught degree programmes. It includes details of academic requirements, notification and explanation of codes, regulations, policies and procedures, as well as the other aspects of University life – sources of help and support, student representation, social opportunities, and facilities and resources available. Additional programme-specific information is detailed in the Programme Summary, which relates specifically to your year of entry.

Where information is available via [UCL Students](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students) webpages or in the [UCL Academic Manual](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/academic-manual), which you should familiarise yourself with, this has been summarised but not replicated in full. Instead, links are given to the relevant materials so that you can be sure you are accessing the most up to date information.

You should be aware that in some cases departmental and faculty rules override the default rules specified in the Academic Manual. If you take modules owned by other departments, you should ensure to refer to the Handbook, or equivalent, for those departments.

## 2. Introduction to the Department and Faculty

An introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.

### 2.1 Department of Computer Science and its history

Computer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.

In 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department’s growth and reflects the leading edge of contemporary computer science.

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.

Our teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world’s challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.

- [Research Excellence Framework](https://www.ref.ac.uk/)
- [Faculty of Engineering teaching](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering/study/undergraduate/how-we-teach)

### 2.2 Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department

The Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department’s taught degree programmes.

UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL’s global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.

Many essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today’s societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.

Though diverse, all the Faculty’s departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.
