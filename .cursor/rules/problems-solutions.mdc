- When invoked via @problems-solutions, append an entry to `docs/THESIS/PROBLEMS_SOLUTIONS.md` using this template:

```
## <Date YYYY-MM-DD> â€” <Short title>

- **Area**: <component/file/path>
- **Symptom**: <what broke / unexpected behavior>
- **Root cause**: <short root cause>
- **Fix**: <what changed>
- **Evidence**: <links to commits/PR/results>
- **Follow-ups**: <tests/docs/monitoring/tasks>
```

- Place newest entries at the top of the file (reverse chronological).
- Preserve existing sections and indentation; do not reformat unrelated content.
- If links refer to local paths, make them relative to repo root.
