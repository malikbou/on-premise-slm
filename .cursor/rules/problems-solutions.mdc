- When invoked via @problems-solutions, append an entry to `docs/THESIS/PROBLEMS_SOLUTIONS.md` using this narrative-friendly template:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> â€” <Short, descriptive title>

- Area: <component/file/path>
- Context
  <What you were trying to accomplish and why it matters.>

- Symptoms
  <What you observed; include error messages and examples.>

- Root cause
  <What was actually wrong; call out version/behavior mismatches.>

- Resolution
  <What you changed (code/config), and why it addressed the root cause.>

- Validation
  <How you verified the fix: checks, sample outputs, metrics.>

- Lessons learned
  <Actionable takeaways and guidance for future work.>

- Evidence
  <Links to commits/PRs, runs, datasets, screenshots, or local paths.>

- Follow-ups
  <Next steps: perf, docs, tests, risks to monitor.>
```

- Place newest entries at the top of the file (reverse chronological).
- Preserve existing sections and indentation; do not reformat unrelated content.
- If links refer to local paths, make them relative to repo root.
