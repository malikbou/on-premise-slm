description: Auto-propose updates to README when behavior changes
globs:
  - src/**
  - scripts/**
  - config.yaml
  - README.md
alwaysApply: false
---

- When diffs in `src/**` or `scripts/**` affect behavior, propose precise edits to:
  - `README.md`: quickstart, features summary, entrypoints, minimal examples.

- Triggers indicating behavior change (non-exhaustive):
  - CLI parsers or command signatures updated (argparse/Typer click options, defaults).
  - API endpoints/routes, request/response schemas, HTTP methods.
  - Config schema keys/types/defaults in `config.yaml` or code.
  - File output locations/names in `data/**`, `results/**`, `results_remote/**`.
  - Notebooks to scripts extraction that changes usage steps.
  - Breaking UX flows, auth, or environment/pre-reqs.

- Proposed edit format:
  - Summarize the change in 1-2 lines.
  - Provide a minimal diff for each target file with exact sections to update.
  - Keep unrelated content untouched; match existing style and indentation.
  - Link to changed files/functions in context.

- Do NOT auto-apply. Always present diffs for review/approval.

- After acceptance, if a new dataset/result path is introduced, suggest adding a row to `docs/THESIS/EXPERIMENTS.md` (if present).
