- Use Python 3.11+ and keep code in `src/` and scripts in `scripts/`.
- Prefer clear, descriptive names; avoid abbreviations. Keep functions small with early returns.
- Add succinct docstrings for complex logic; avoid comments for trivial code.
- Do not reformat unrelated code; match existing style and indentation.
- Handle errors meaningfully; avoid catching without handling.
- When editing notebooks in `src/testset/`, preserve cell order and IDs when possible.
- Save generated datasets to `data/testset/` using timestamped filenames.
- Run lightweight checks after edits; fix trivial linter issues immediately.
- For evaluation logic, consider impacts on `results/` and `results_remote/` structures.
