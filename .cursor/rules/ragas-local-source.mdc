description: Prefer reading local ragas source in vendor/ragas over external docs

- When working with ragas, rely on `vendor/ragas/**` to understand APIs and behavior.
- Read function/class definitions and docstrings directly; avoid assuming online docs are accurate.
- If a method is unclear, first search usages within `vendor/ragas` before external search.
- Summarize relevant code sections inline when proposing changes.
- Continue importing the installed `ragas` package in project code; the vendor copy is for Agent context and code reading.
- Keep the vendor mirror fresh after upgrading ragas by running:
  - `python scripts/vendor_ragas.py`
- Exclude large artifacts from the mirror (e.g., `__pycache__`, tests, assets) to keep context lean.
- Typical touchpoints in this repo: question/testset generation, metrics computation, evaluation flows.
- Mapping tip: from calls in `src/testset`/`src/benchmarking`/`src/throughput`, open corresponding definitions in `vendor/ragas` to verify parameters and return types.
