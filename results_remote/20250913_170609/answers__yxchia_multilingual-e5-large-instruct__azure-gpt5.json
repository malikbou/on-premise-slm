Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students",

Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group.

These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.  \nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.

When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.  \nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)"

Taught students have a maximum of 3 Delayed Assessment Permits to use during the year. Each permit grants you a set mitigation such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. There are no minimum grounds, but you should think carefully before using your permit. Make sure to review the restrictions of the scheme, and note that not all assessments are eligible. Short-term Illness and other Extenuating Circumstances You have a short-term illness, bereavement or other unexpected emergency. Normally you must provide evidence. 'Extenuating Circumstances' (often know as 'ECs') are events which are sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond your control and which may affect your performance at summative assessment, such as a serious illness or the death of a close relative. You can submit an Extenuating Circumstances claim to access 'mitigation' such as an extension or deferring an assessment to a later date. Reasonable Adjustments for Disabilities and Long-term Conditions You have a disability or long-term physical or mental health condition. UCL can provide longer-term 'Reasonable Adjustments' to support your learning and assessment. This includes setting up a 'SoRA' (Summary of Reasonable Adjustments) with UCL's Student Support and Wellbeing team.

The Delayed Assessment Scheme entitles all taught students to pre-determined flexibility for a small number of eligible assessments throughout the year. Our hope is that by providing students with tools to access mitigations when they need, students can develop healthy and resilient approaches to their studies.  \nThe Delayed Assessment Scheme provides students a maximum of 3 permits to use during each year of study. Each Delayed Assessment Permit (DAP) entitles a student to a pre-determined mitigation for an assessment such as a 5 working day extension or deferral. Please note; mitigations are pre-determined and not all assessments are eligible.  \nMitigation for late submission via the extenuating circumstances procedure  \nIf a student experiences something which prevents them from meeting a deadline that is sudden, unexpected, significantly disruptive and beyond their control, they should submit an Extenuating Circumstances (EC) Form via Portico.

      "Academic integrity in Computer Science modules  \nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.  \nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.  \nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them.

      "One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.  \nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place.

Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.  \nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.",
      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",
      "Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.  \nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.  \nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module  \nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once."

Regarding assessments, the department carefully manages assessment dates to consider students' workloads. Assessments for Computer Science modules typically include coursework, tests, presentations, and examinations. Coursework submissions usually occur during the term in which the module is delivered plus two to three weeks. Examinations take place from 29 April to 30 May 2025, with additional late summer assessment periods and a January resit period for postgraduate taught programmes. Assessment deadlines may be set during Reading Weeks but not during closure periods, weekends, or UK bank holidays, ensuring a balanced workload for students."

These references support applications for jobs or further study and should be requested well in advance, as they are typically only possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners and may take several weeks to prepare, especially during busy periods. To assist students throughout their academic journey, the Teaching and Learning Team offers extensive support, including a dedicated member who can advise on various issues and connect students with appropriate resources. Students also have access to the Computer Science Student Intranet for news and events, and can engage with Student Representatives who present cohort views and collaborate with staff to enhance the student experience.

For direct queries, the Teaching and Learning team offers virtual drop-in sessions on Teams during term time, including Thursday sessions from 11am to 12pm (UK time) for all students, where no appointment is needed but a queue system operates. These sessions provide a quicker way to resolve queries than email. Students should have their Student ID ready when joining the drop-in.

    "reference": "The Department of Computer Science at UCL offers a portfolio of taught programmes designed to engage students and equip them with skills to address global challenges. These programmes have evolved alongside the department's growth and reflect contemporary computer science. Modules are delivered across the academic year, with assessments typically including coursework such as online or class tests, oral exams, presentations, and practical assessments. For Computer Science modules, coursework assessments are usually submitted during the term in which the module is delivered, plus an additional two to three weeks. Term 1 modules are assessed from Week 6 to Week 20, and Term 2 modules from Week 21 to Week 32. Examinations for these modules take place between 29 April and 30 May 2025. The academic year is divided into three terms: Term 1 runs from 23 September 2024 to 13 December 2024, Term 2 from 13 January 2025 to 28 March 2025, and Term 3 from 28 April 2025 to 13 June 2025. Reading weeks occur during the weeks beginning 4 November 2024 and 17 February 2025. The department carefully manages assessment dates to consider students' workloads, and deadlines are not set during closure periods, weekends, or UK bank holidays. Final year projects and dissertations have assessment periods to be confirmed. This structure ensures that teaching programmes and module assessments are well integrated with the academic calendar and provide clear timelines for students."

      "Introduction to the department and faculty  \nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.  \nDepartment of Computer Science and its history  \nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.  \nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.  \nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.  \nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.  \nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department",

Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",

These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.  \nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff.

Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.  \n[Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](  \nSurveys and questionnaires  \nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.

The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning.

Feedback may include indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual or group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers, or other solutions. However, examination scripts are generally not returned; instead, cohort-level feedback summarizing general issues and areas for improvement is provided. If feedback is delayed beyond the expected timeframe, students should notify the module's Programme Director or Departmental Tutor. Regarding Personal Tutoring, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student is assigned a personal tutor who provides constructive academic and personal development guidance.

When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.  \nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)",

Course Representatives work closely with departmental staff to communicate student priorities and address areas for improvement. They are members of the Staff Student Consultative Committee, the main departmental forum for student feedback and agency. Additionally, two Lead Departmental Representatives are appointed from Course Reps to co-chair these committees and liaise between the Students' Union and Course Representatives. Faculty Representatives also work with the Students' Union to identify trends and raise issues at the faculty level. The Students' Union supports all academic representatives by providing training, advice, and support to help them improve the student experience across UCL.
