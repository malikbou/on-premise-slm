Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students",

Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group.

When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.  \nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards. UCL also has online tools available to help students identify what behaviours may be considered as academic misconduct (for example, the Turnitin service can be used to help students ensure their written work is properly attributed.)"

      "Academic integrity in Computer Science modules  \nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.  \nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.  \nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.  \nAcademic misconduct through the use of contract cheating  \nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.",

In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.  \nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.  \nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.  \nYou Shape UCL | UCL  \nSurvey News and Results | UCL  \nStudent surveys  \nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.",
      "Information on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.  \nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis.  \nThese pulse surveys are important because it helps teaching staff 'check-in' with students, making sure that they can understand and access key aspects such as the content of the module, assessment information and learning resources. This provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning and also give constructive feedback by engaging in a dialogue with staff about the results. Helpful comments and ideas from students mean that changes and improvements can be made to the module before it ends, as well as shaping the module for future students.  \nUCL Changemakers  \nInformation on the UCL ChangeMakers scheme and how students can get involved.  \nUCL ChangeMakers helps students and staff work in partnership to make education better at UCL: - Students and staff can apply for funding to collaborate on a project focused on enhancing education and students' experience at UCL. - Projects address issues that are important to students, often uncovered through student survey data, discussed at Student Partnership Committees, raised through Unitu or as the result of ideas from students and/or staff. - Students are recognised for their contribution to enhancing education at UCL through the payment of a stipend. - There are two application deadlines a year, in terms 1 and 2.  \nProjects are open to all students: undergraduate, postgraduate taught and postgraduate research (MRes).  \nStudent Quality Reviewers  \nInformation on what Student Quality Reviewers are and how students can get involved.",

Whether it's about teaching, accommodation, or facilities, surveys are a chance for students to have their say about what works and what needs improving, to help us make sure that UCL is delivering an excellent education for current and future students. Each survey takes just a few minutes to complete, all responses are anonymous, and some include a generous prize draw.  \nEvery piece of feedback is read, and the results of each survey are shared with staff across UCL - including President & Provost Dr Michael Spence.  \nNational Student Survey | Office for Students  \nPostgraduate Taught Experience Survey | Advance HE  \nModule dialogue  \nInformation on module feedback, including when they occur and why they are important.  \nThroughout all modules students will be asked to answer short pulse survey questions, on a regular basis."

    "reference": "At UCL, summative assessments are designed to evaluate students' achievement of a module's learning outcomes and contribute to their academic outcome. Each module has one or more summative components, each with a defined method, title, and weight, collectively known as the module's assessment pattern. Feedback on summative assessments is a key part of the learning process. UCL policy mandates that all students receive feedback within one calendar month of the submission deadline, which may include provisional marks, written feedback, discussions, or model answers. If delays occur, students are informed, and the extra time should not exceed one week. Specifically, the Computer Science department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends and holidays. Feedback may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research projects or dissertations, draft feedback is provided within 10 working days if the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline. The department monitors feedback return and notifies students of any delays via Moodle. Regarding provisional marks, Computer Science usually releases them alongside coursework feedback, but provisional marks are not released for examinations due to their proximity to final result publication. Final marks are confirmed and released via Student Registry Services after Board of Examiners approval."

Regarding academic misconduct, the department has clear regulations defining misconduct, such as unauthorized use or sharing of code, and a zero-tolerance approach to contract cheating. Investigations into suspected misconduct involve examiners reviewing originality and integrity of submitted work, potentially using tools like Turnitin or Measure of Software Similarity, and may include oral examinations or panels. Penalties for confirmed misconduct can range up to exclusion from UCL or rescindment of qualifications.

The Main assessment period for Computer Science modules includes coursework submissions during the terms in which the modules are delivered (Term 1 from Week 06 to Week 20, Term 2 from Week 21 to Week 32) and examinations typically held between 29 April and 30 May 2025. This structured timeline and feedback policy ensure students receive timely and clear information about their provisional marks and feedback during the Main assessment period."

The Advice Service offers free, independent, impartial, and confidential support to all current UCL students, including those who have interrupted their studies or recently completed their programme. It specialises in academic advice, complaints and disciplinaries, housing issues, employment rights, and financial support. Meanwhile, informal resolution encourages students to raise concerns directly with Personal Tutors, Programme Leaders, Departmental or Faculty Tutors, Course Representatives, or Research Student Representatives before submitting a formal complaint. Staff office hours, held regularly by Programme Directors and Module Leaders, provide informal drop-in sessions where students can raise issues, concerns, or problems without prior appointment. These sessions serve as an accessible first step for students to discuss their difficulties, potentially resolving matters locally. If issues remain unresolved, the Academic Representatives summarize concerns and escalate them within an Academic forum. Together, these mechanisms ensure students have multiple avenues for support and resolution, with the Advice Service complementing the informal routes by offering expert guidance and advocacy throughout the complaint process."

    "reference": "UCL places great importance on student feedback by involving students as partners in shaping education. Feedback mechanisms include the student representative scheme, module dialogue via Moodle forums, departmental student voice platforms, and various student surveys such as the National Student Survey, Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey, and New to UCL survey. This feedback has led to tangible improvements like opening the Library during Christmas closure, increasing study spaces including 1000 seats in the 24-hour Student Centre, focusing on environmental sustainability, and providing clearer exam and assessment information. Regarding Student Support and Wellbeing, UCL offers a wide range of services to ensure a fulfilling and healthy student experience. Students are encouraged to proactively seek support through their Personal Tutor, Programme Director, or Programme Administrator. The Student Enquiries Centre (SEC), located on the 1st floor of the Student Centre, provides walk-in, telephone, and online askUCL enquiry services to assist with questions about student records, visas, fees, study abroad, and wellbeing. The SEC operates during term-time with specific hours for walk-in and telephone services, and self-service options are available via Portico and askUCL for efficient access to documentation and FAQs."
