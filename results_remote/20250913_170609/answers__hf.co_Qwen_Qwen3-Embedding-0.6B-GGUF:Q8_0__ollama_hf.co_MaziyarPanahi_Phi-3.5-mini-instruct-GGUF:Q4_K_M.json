Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students"

      "Introduction to the department and faculty  \nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.  \nDepartment of Computer Science and its history  \nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.  \nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.  \nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.  \nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.  \nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department",

      "Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department  \nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.  \nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.  \nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.  \nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.  \nKey staff in the department and faculty"

We value students' feedback and work with students as partners in the process of shaping education at UCL. In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.  \nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.  \nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.  \nYou Shape UCL | UCL  \nSurvey News and Results | UCL  \nStudent surveys  \nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.",

Specifically, students have access to a careers tutor within the department, Tigmanshu Bhatnagar, who offers guidance on making the most of UCL's careers resources. For practical experience, students can undertake optional internships during the summer between academic years, which are not part of the degree programme but provide valuable skills and experience. Additionally, the department offers paid research internships over the summer with research staff or teams. Students may also apply for a 'Year in Industry' to take a year-long placement with an approved industry partner, which formally extends the degree by one year. Final year projects and dissertations may involve industrial collaboration through the Industry Exchange Network, sometimes requiring on-site engagement. These employability and career development opportunities align with the broader context of UCL East, which is highlighted as the biggest development in UCL's history and is welcoming its second cohort of students. UCL East represents an exciting expansion of the university's multidisciplinary academic culture, providing a dynamic environment where students can shape their journey and benefit from enhanced educational and career-related opportunities."

If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published.

Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",

The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.  \nUCL feedback policy",

All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.  \nComputer Science marking policies  \nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.  \nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.  \nExternal examining  \nInformation about external examining at UCL."

    "reference": "At UCL, summative assessments are designed to evaluate students' achievement of a module's learning outcomes and contribute to their academic outcome. Each module has one or more summative components, each with a defined method, title, and weight, collectively known as the module's assessment pattern. Feedback on summative assessments is a key part of the learning process. UCL policy mandates that all students receive feedback within one calendar month of the submission deadline, which may include provisional marks, written feedback, discussions, or model answers. If delays occur, students are informed, and the extra time should not exceed one week. Specifically, the Computer Science department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends and holidays. Feedback may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research projects or dissertations, draft feedback is provided within 10 working days if the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline. The department monitors feedback return and notifies students of any delays via Moodle. Regarding provisional marks, Computer Science usually releases them alongside coursework feedback, but provisional marks are not released for examinations due to their proximity to final result publication.

      "UCL's Student Support Framework  \nDetails of how UCL and the department will support students through their studies.  \nAbout the UCL Student Support Framework  \nUCL is committed to providing the support students need in order to make the most out of their studies. The Student Support Framework draws together our main academic support processes under one banner to help students understand the options open to them.  \nUCL's Student Support Framework  \nThe Framework includes the following components:  \nPart 1: How to Use this Framework  \nHelps students find their way around the different support options open to them. It includes: - Where to find help and advice - Information about when to use this framework (for example if you are an affiliate, study abroad or placement student) - Advice on confidentiality and how UCL will look after student data - Information on providing supporting evidence - Links to other support options that are available to students.  \nPart 2: Types of Support explains how each of the following processes works:",
      "Go Abroad | UCL Students  \nAccommodation  \nUCL Accommodation provides a range of housing options which includes two Halls of Residence (catered), self-catered Student Houses and Intercollegiate Halls (both catered and self-catered) shared with other colleges of the University of London. Each Hall has a designated Warden supported by a number of live-in Student Residence Advisers (SRA) to provide support for students and to foster a positive environment within the accommodation.  \nAccommodation | UCL Students  \nFinancial support  \nThe UCL Student Funding Office provides a central service aimed at supporting students with money matters. We can assist with scholarship, bursary and loan queries, and help signpost students to sources of funding. We also offer a range of resources and tips on money management. The easiest way to access our information and guidance is online, but for students with more complex circumstances an appointment can be booked with one of our Student Funding Advisers.  \nSupport for financial issues | UCL Students  \nStudent of Concern  \nThere are many sources of support for students who are having difficulties, but sometimes it is hard to know how to help a student who appears to be struggling, particularly if they seem unwilling or unable to seek the help they need. Anyone concerned about the behaviour of a student, who believes the problem may be related to health and wellbeing issues, is encouraged to complete the online UCL Student of Concern Form.  \nDepending on the concerns raised, Student Support and Wellbeing may respond by offering support or advice to the student or the person who submitted the form, liaise with support services or, if necessary, work with the relevant authorities to ensure the student is safe."

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.  \nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.  \nAssessment information on Moodle  \nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team (cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk).  \nAccess to Moodle pages  \nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered.

      "UCL feedback policy  \nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring  \nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)  \nPersonal and academic tutoring  \nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.  \nPersonal tutoring  \nSupport via Personal Tutoring  \nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.  \nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.  \nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.",
      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",
      "Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.  \nChapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual  \nChapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual  \nMarking scales  \nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.  \nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.  \nUCL feedback policy"

If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",

The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning.

This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "UCL Research Ethics | UCL  \nMarking, second-marking, and moderation  \nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.  \nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.  \nComputer Science marking policies  \nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.  \nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.  \nExternal examining  \nInformation about external examining at UCL."

    "reference": "UCL policy requires that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. For Computer Science taught modules, feedback for summative assessments is typically released within 20 working days of the assessment or submission deadline, excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays. Feedback may include indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual or group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers, or other solutions. However, examination scripts are generally not returned, and feedback on examinations is usually provided as cohort-level feedback summarizing general issues and areas for improvement. Provisional marks for coursework are usually released alongside feedback, but provisional marks for examinations are not released due to the proximity of exams to the publication of confirmed results. Regarding assessment and examination periods for the 2024/25 academic year, Computer Science coursework assessments typically occur during the term in which the module is delivered plus approximately 2-3 weeks. Examinations are scheduled from 29 April to 30 May 2025 for the main assessment period, with a late summer examination period from 18 August to 5 September 2025. Final year projects and dissertations have dates to be confirmed. Students should expect feedback timelines to align with these assessment periods, and any delays in feedback will be communicated via the module's Moodle forum or through departmental contacts."
