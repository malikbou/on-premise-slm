A formative assessment is one that is primarily intended to help students develop and test their own understanding but does not count towards a student's academic outcome on the module (i.e. whether they have achieved the learning outcomes and thus pass and are awarded credit for the module.) A summative assessment is one that is primarily intended to evaluate students' achievement of the module's learning outcomes and counts towards a student's academic outcome on the module.  \nA student is awarded credit for a module where their performance in its summative assessments meets the requirements to pass the module.  \nAssessment structure",

Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",

      "Academic integrity in Computer Science modules  \nFor Computer Science modules, the following acts all constitute academic misconduct unless otherwise stated by the responsible assessment-setter or instructors on the module: - Taking code from the internet (or anywhere else) that was written by another person and submitting it for a programming coursework (except code provided by the module's examiners or instructors.) - Asking questions about how to solve a coursework on a discussion forum or channel (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Facebook) (except any official discussion forum run by the module's instructors, e.g., on Moodle or EdStem.) - Making a coursework solution available to another student; note that UCL's Academic Misconduct regulations regard the \"giver\" and \"receiver\" of material as equally culpable.  \nStudents should take appropriate steps to safeguard their work to ensure it is not made available to other students. For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.  \nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them. If a student is ever unsure whether taking some action violates UCL or UCL Computer Science's rules governing academic integrity, they should consult their module leader before acting.  \nAcademic misconduct through the use of contract cheating  \nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.",
      "Academic misconduct through the use of contract cheating  \nStudents work must be conducted in accordance with UCL's guidelines and requirements.  \nUCL has a zero-tolerance approach to the use of essay mills and contract cheating by students (i.e., where an external party is induced to produce or undertake work on behalf of a UCL student.) These types of service are antithetical to UCL's principles, disadvantage honest students, and devalue standards in our universities.  \nStudents should be aware that the department conducts periodic checks of external service providers and is able to undertake investigatory oral examinations where it suspects academic misconduct through the use of such a service. If a student has graduated and is subsequently found to have used a contract cheating service, UCL may rescind their degree.  \nInvestigating and penalising academic misconduct  \nExaminers will, as a matter of course, consider the originality and integrity of the work students submit, for example based on their own knowledge of the domain and relevant source material, and patterns in the work that has been submitted.  \nIn addition, examiners may undertake further checks of any work submitted for assessment, for example using the Turnitin service for written work or Measure of Software Similarity service for code. Such checks may be of the whole cohort, a sample of submissions, or submissions of concern, carried out at the point of submission or, if academic misconduct is suspected, the examiner may elect to undertake an investigatory oral examination or convene a panel to review any suspected misconduct.",

When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.  \nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards.

      "Introduction to the department and faculty  \nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.  \nDepartment of Computer Science and its history  \nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.  \nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.  \nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.  \nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.  \nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department",
      "Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department  \nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.  \nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.  \nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.  \nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.  \nKey staff in the department and faculty",
      "One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff. The creativity and breadth of ideas this provides is key to exploiting core computer science skills effectively. These values and activities pervade the teaching we deliver to you.  \nSo I encourage you to embrace the opportunities of being part of this amazing place. Help shape the department and the discipline as they evolve into the future. And let them shape you as a computer scientist and a human being.  \nI am excited to meet you and look forward to working with you all over the coming year.  \nProf. Daniel Alexander Head of Department  \nTeaching and Learning Team welcome  \nA warm welcome to our new students and welcome back to our returning students."

When Academic Misconduct occurs, there can potentially be penalties imposed, and it is important to note that repeated breaches will be taken very seriously and could result in exclusion from UCL, as per the Student Academic Misconduct Procedure Adjudication Framework.  \nFor students who are unsure of what may be considered as academic misconduct, the procedures in Chapter 6 of the Academic Manual define all such behaviour and how this is taken forwards.

      "Introduction to the department and faculty  \nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.  \nDepartment of Computer Science and its history  \nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.  \nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.  \nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.  \nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.  \nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department"

Regarding assessments, the department carefully manages assessment dates to consider students' workloads. Assessments for Computer Science modules typically include coursework, tests, presentations, and examinations. Coursework submissions usually occur during the term in which the module is delivered plus two to three weeks. Examinations take place from 29 April to 30 May 2025, with additional late summer assessment periods and a January resit period for postgraduate taught programmes. Assessment deadlines may be set during Reading Weeks but not during closure periods, weekends, or UK bank holidays, ensuring a balanced workload for students."

    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",
      "UCL feedback policy  \nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.  \nChapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual  \nChapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual  \nMarking scales  \nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.  \nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning.

All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.  \nComputer Science marking policies  \nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.  \nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible.

Each module has one or more summative components, each with a defined method, title, and weight, collectively known as the module's assessment pattern. Feedback on summative assessments is a key part of the learning process. UCL policy mandates that all students receive feedback within one calendar month of the submission deadline, which may include provisional marks, written feedback, discussions, or model answers. If delays occur, students are informed, and the extra time should not exceed one week. Specifically, the Computer Science department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends and holidays. Feedback may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research projects or dissertations, draft feedback is provided within 10 working days if the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline. The department monitors feedback return and notifies students of any delays via Moodle.

If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published.

      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",
      "UCL feedback policy  \nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",

The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning.

    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "UCL feedback policy  \nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "Tutorials, supervision, and mentoring  \nInformation on what students can expect in terms of academic and Personal Tutoring (Central and Local.)  \nPersonal and academic tutoring  \nUCL is committed to providing all students with the academic guidance and personal support that they need to flourish as members of our active learning and research community.  \nPersonal tutoring  \nSupport via Personal Tutoring  \nAs part of the wider support infrastructure provided by a programme, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student will be assigned a member of staff who can provide constructive academic and personal development guidance and support.  \nAt the start of the year, students will be provided with the name of their personal tutor, and information about how meetings will work. Students are encouraged to be proactive in engaging with their Personal Tutor: make sure they reply to emails from their personal tutor in a timely manner and always let them know if they can't attend a meeting. It's important for students to build a relationship with their tutor so they feel comfortable approaching them, should problems arise. A personal tutor can also provide academic references, which is an important reason to build a professional relationship with them.  \nStudents should meet with their Personal Tutor at a minimum once each Term. The Personal Tutor/ tutee relationship is an important one, and students should actively engage with this. For some programmes, Personal Tutor meetings take the form of small tutorial groups, where tutees meet with their Personal Tutor collectively.",
      "The department will proactively monitor the return of feedback for Computer Science modules, and will take appropriate action where delays occur. Students should expect that any delay will be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. If this does not occur, students should notify the Departmental Tutor either directly or via their Course Representative.  \nComputer Science exam script policy  \nUCL is generally unable to return written examination scripts and will not do so as a means of providing feedback. Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",

Students must ensure the work they submit is assessable (i.e., is legible, in an appropriate format, and digital assets can be opened) and is the correct version. Unless otherwise stated, work submitted before the deadline can be replaced (re-submitted) up to but not after the deadline.  \nSupport for coursework submission  \nTechnical support for submission via Moodle is provided by the Information Service Division (ISD) Help Desk via email, telephone or in person. The Help Desk is available Monday to Friday between 08:30 and 17:30 (UK time.) Students can also seek advice from the Programme Administrator for their programme, who can advise on the submission procedure and help resolve any common problems students may experience.  \nSupport for Computer Science specific applications and platforms is available from the Computer Science Technical Support Group or the examiner who set the assessment; usually the examiner will specify in the assessment instructions any task-specific guidance relating to technical support, where that applies.  \nPenalties for late submission for coursework and dissertations  \nCoursework, portfolios, and projects/ dissertations, are examples of submitted assessments, where work must be submitted for assessment by a given deadline date and time.  \nPlanning, time-management and the meeting of deadlines are part of the personal and professional skills expected of all graduates. For this reason, UCL expects students to submit all coursework by the published deadline date and time, after which penalties will be applied to the late component, (unless mitigation is subsequently approved via the short-term illness and extenuating circumstances procedure.)"

      "Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department  \nThe Department of Computer Science works closely with the Faculty of Engineering Sciences and its teaching departments to ensure that opportunities to create novel and exciting synergies in both research and teaching are fully exploited. For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.  \nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.  \nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.  \nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.  \nKey staff in the department and faculty"

Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)  \nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department.

Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students"

Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.  \nModules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)  \nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)  \nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.  \nComputer Science | Study Abroad at UCL",
      "Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.  \nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.  \nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module  \nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.",
      "Most modules have one or more coursework-based assessment tasks. The task instructions, marking criteria, and assessment deadline will be published via the module's Moodle page at the point the assessment is set. If a student is having difficulties understanding any aspect of the coursework, they should consult the member of staff who was responsible for setting it in the first instance. Ideally, and by default, coursework queries should be posted to the module's Moodle discussion forum so that all students benefit from any discussion. Module Leaders may set their own expectations for how issues should be raised.  \nCoursework scheduling  \nCoursework is scheduled by the module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, coursework will usually take place as follows: - Term 1 modules: Weeks 6 - 20 (inclusive.) - Term 2 modules: Weeks 21 - 32 (inclusive.)  \nUnless otherwise stated, the deadline time is 4:00pm (UK time) for submitted work, including if an extension has been granted via the Extenuating Circumstances Procedure. Coursework deadlines are published on each module's Moodle page in the assessment section.  \nCoursework submission  \nProcedures for coursework submission are set by each module's teaching department. For Computer Science modules, students must submit coursework digitally unless otherwise stated. The examiner may prescribe a particular file format, naming convention, protocol for group work, or composition for the submission, to which students should adhere.",
      "Module information & selection  \nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.  \nModules  \nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students"

Regarding personal tutoring, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student, including Computer Science students, is assigned a personal tutor who provides constructive academic and personal development guidance and support. Students receive the name of their personal tutor at the start of the year and are encouraged to engage proactively, meeting at least once each term. Personal tutors help build a professional relationship, offer academic references, and support students throughout their studies. Additionally, Computer Science first-year undergraduates benefit from a Programming Tutoring Scheme, where more advanced students provide small-group programming support to help beginners develop proficiency in languages such as C, Haskell, Java, and Python 3."

In recent years, as a direct result of student feedback, we have opened the Library over the Christmas closure period and increased study space - including 1000 in the 24-hour new Student Centre, we've focussed more on environmental sustainability and given clearer information about exams and assessments.  \nThe framework of committees, processes, and activities through which students can provide feedback includes: - The student representative scheme, where the student body elects representatives across its programmes to act as the student voice (see Section 17 Student representation and voice | CS Student Handbook.  \nOther opportunities for students to feed back on their experience include active dialogue with their module leaders via Moodle discussion forums, posting ideas or issues of concerns to their departmental student voice platform, or attending office hours with module leaders, programme directors, or with the Departmental Tutor.  \nYou Shape UCL | UCL  \nSurvey News and Results | UCL  \nStudent surveys  \nStudent surveys and how UCL uses the results, including information about the NSS, PTES and New to UCL survey.",

Feedback on examinations should usually take the form of cohort-level feedback, which summarises general issues and areas for improvement based on the performance of the cohort. Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published.

These sessions are intended as informal drop-ins where students can raise any issues of concerns, ideas for improvement, or problems they may be experiencing. Students are welcome to attend these sessions without notification or appointment; most sessions operate a lobby-based queue system.  \nOffice hours will either be listed in the timetable or advertised to students by the responsible staff. The aim is for these sessions to run regularly, but they cannot be guaranteed to run every week. Students should feel free to contact the relevant staff by email where an office hour is not available.  \n[Office Hours & Drop-in Sessions | CS Student Handbook](  \nSurveys and questionnaires  \nStudents will be invited to provide feedback on their individual modules via Module Evaluative Questionnaires (MEQs) at the end of each term.

For Computer Science taught modules, feedback is aimed to be released within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays. Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. If a department cannot meet the one calendar month deadline, they must inform students of the revised feedback date, which should not exceed an additional week.
