For example, in shared computing environments, students should set permissions on files containing coursework solutions so others cannot read them. Students should not make assessment solutions available to the general public (e.g., in a public GitHub repository, or a repository accessible to other UCL students) as this would constitute sharing their work.  \nFinally, claiming ignorance of these regulations does not exempt anyone from them.

      "Introduction to the department and faculty  \nAn introduction to the department and its parent faculty, their relationship, and key contacts within both.  \nDepartment of Computer Science and its history  \nComputer Science was established at UCL in the early 1970s when the Department of Statistics was expanded to form a joint Department of Statistics and Computer Science. The initial nucleus of computer scientists came from the University of London Institute of Computer Science, which was renowned for its established MSc programme and for its research.  \nIn 1980 the independent Department of Computer Science was formed with Professor Peter Kirstein as its first Head. At that time there were seven academic staff (including three professors) and just one main research area: computer networks and data communications. Today, our portfolio of taught programmes has developed in line with the department's growth and reflects the leadingedge of contemporary computer science.  \nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework evaluation UCL was ranked in first place for Computer Science, out of 89 Universities assessed. 61% of its research work is rated as world-leading (the highest possible category) and 96% is rated as internationally excellent.  \nOur teaching programmes are designed to engage students and give them the skills to address the world's challenges. We have pioneered new teaching methods for our undergraduates, and involve our postgraduates with our cutting-edge, highly rated academic research. The graduates we educate progress to a wide range of roles within engineering and technology sectors and beyond.  \nFaculty of Engineering Sciences and its relationship with the department",

It will have profound influence on life on Earth. It is all of you that will lead these advances. Our aim is to equip you to achieve that with skill, rigour, integrity, and a clear and complete understanding of how your work influences the world.  \nIt starts with the basics: understanding new concepts; solving problems; debugging code; writing reports. These are the skills that enable the sublime: revolutions in AI, healthcare, finance, media, the way we learn, work, and govern the country.",
      "One word captures the uniqueness of our department: diversity. We adopt a broad definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. While we embrace fundamental theory, we also have a strong emphasis on applications and translation of theory into practical tools that impact the real world. We are highly multidisciplinary, working closely with every other UCL faculty linking to medicine and health, arts and humanities, politics and law, education, maths and life sciences. We collaborate with partners in industry, health services, and government to translate computational advances to impact. We are committed to removing barriers to achieving excellence and fostering inclusive and diverse cohorts of students and staff.

For example, the department participates in the Integrated Engineering Programme (IEP), which provides undergraduate students with opportunities to engage in a broad range of interdisciplinary activity. Similarly, joint research initiatives link Computer Science with a broad range of other research groups in the Faculty, and this feeds directly into the design of the department's taught degree programmes.  \nUCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences is uniquely international, reflecting UCL's global outlook. Formally organised within academic departments, its work and impact transcend the boundaries between academic subjects and departments. The Faculty of Engineering Sciences works with ten other diverse faculties at UCL, from the Slade School of Fine Art to the School of Life and Medical Sciences, to produce innovative, multidisciplinary work.  \nMany essential technologies originated from studies and work at UCL, including the rapid production of vaccines, fibre-optic communications (for which a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded) and the Internet infrastructure. The complexity of today's societies means that engineers deal with an incredible range of challenges, ideas and techniques.  \nThough diverse, all the Faculty's departments, institutes and centres specialise in combining the analysis and rigour of science with a spark of innovation and practicality, to change the world.  \nKey staff in the department and faculty"

Importantly, any change in registration status must be communicated to the Student Loans Company (SLC) to update their records and reassess funding. The Faculty submits a Change of Circumstance Form to the SLC on the student's behalf, with queries directed initially to the Programme Administrator.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.  \nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.  \nAssessment information on Moodle  \nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team (cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk).  \nAccess to Moodle pages  \nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered. They may request access to the pages of Computer Science modules for which they are not registered, for self-directed learning (or 'auditing'), however this is at the discretion of the Module Leader and may be refused.  \nMoodle Resource Centre | UCL Wiki  \nPortico",

Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",

    "reference": "At UCL, summative assessments are designed to evaluate students' achievement of a module's learning outcomes and contribute to their academic outcome. Each module has one or more summative components, each with a defined method, title, and weight, collectively known as the module's assessment pattern. Feedback on summative assessments is a key part of the learning process. UCL policy mandates that all students receive feedback within one calendar month of the submission deadline, which may include provisional marks, written feedback, discussions, or model answers. If delays occur, students are informed, and the extra time should not exceed one week. Specifically, the Computer Science department aims to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends and holidays. Feedback may be withheld until approved extensions are completed to ensure fairness. For research projects or dissertations, draft feedback is provided within 10 working days if the draft is submitted at least 15 working days before the final deadline. The department monitors feedback return and notifies students of any delays via Moodle. Regarding provisional marks, Computer Science usually releases them alongside coursework feedback, but provisional marks are not released for examinations due to their proximity to final result publication. Final marks are confirmed and released via Student Registry Services after Board of Examiners approval."

For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow.

It includes a wide range of tools which can be used to support learning and teaching. Moodle is used to supplement taught modules, in some cases just by providing essential information and materials, but it can also be integrated more fully, becoming an essential component of a module. Some modules may use Moodle to provide access to readings, videos, activities, collaboration tools and assessments.  \nAll taught modules at Computer Science have a Moodle page that supports their delivery. Depending on the approach taken by the Module Leader, the Moodle page may be used more or less intensively, particularly where alternative teaching environments are used in addition. Students should pay close attending to their module's Moodle forum, as this is where tutors will usually post updates about classes and answer questions.  \nAssessment information on Moodle  \nEach module's Moodle page must include an assessment section that sets out the module's summative assessment information, including the titles and weightings of the assessments and any submission deadlines. If this information is not present, then please contact the Assessment Team (cs.assessment-team@ucl.ac.uk).  \nAccess to Moodle pages  \nStudents will be automatically granted access to the Moodle pages of modules for which they are registered.

The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning.

However, examination scripts are generally not returned; instead, cohort-level feedback summarizing general issues and areas for improvement is provided. If feedback is delayed beyond the expected timeframe, students should notify the module's Programme Director or Departmental Tutor. Regarding Personal Tutoring, every undergraduate or taught postgraduate student is assigned a personal tutor who provides constructive academic and personal development guidance. Students are encouraged to engage proactively with their personal tutor, meeting at least once each term, to discuss academic progress and any issues. This relationship supports students in managing their studies effectively throughout the term."

The SEC assists with enquiries related to student records, Visa, Fees, Study Abroad, Student Support and Wellbeing, and other study-related matters. Additionally, UCL values student feedback highly and uses it to shape education and services. For example, as a direct result of student feedback, UCL has opened the Library over the Christmas closure period, increased study spaces including 1000 seats in the 24-hour Student Centre, improved environmental sustainability efforts, and provided clearer information about exams and assessments. Feedback is gathered through various channels such as student representatives, module leader dialogues, departmental platforms, and online surveys like the National Student Survey and Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey. This feedback is carefully reviewed and shared with UCL staff, including senior leadership, to ensure continuous improvement in student experience."

Individualised or highly detailed feedback is neither appropriate or possible for examinations.  \nComputer Science provisional marks policy  \nUCL permits departments to release provisional marks for assessments prior to their confirmation by the Board of Examiners. For coursework, provisional marks will usually be released alongside feedback on the assessment; sometimes feedback will be released first, and provisional marks will follow. For examinations, provisional marks will not be released, since the exams take place very close to the point confirmed results are published. In all cases, final marks will be released via Student Registry Services, following their confirmation by the Board of Examiners.  \nSection 5: Assessment Feedback | UCL Academic Manual  \nExaminations  \nInformation on written examinations and a link to the UCL Examination Guide for Candidates on the Examinations and Awards website.  \nAn examination is a short duration test-like assessment that is taken under specific conditions, usually at a fixed time, and which requires adherence to a strict code of practice.",
      "Students are encouraged to contact the responsible examiner with any queries relating to how work will be marked or what is expected, either in class, via the Moodle discussion forum, or during Office Hours. In the event that assessment information is missing, incomplete, or unclear, students should contact the relevant examiner or Module leader, which should be via the module's Moodle discussion forum.  \nChapter 4, Section 2: Assessment Information | UCL Academic Manual  \nChapter 4, Section 4: Marking & Moderation | UCL Academic Manual  \nMarking scales  \nComputer Science operates a Numeric Marking Scale on its taught programmes of study, which means that each module is awarded a numerical mark (on a scale of 0.00 - 100.00) based on students' performance in that module's summative components of assessment.  \nSome components are binary marked, which means that a genuine attempt will be awarded a mark of 100.00, otherwise the work will be given mark of 0.00. The aim of these assessments is to help students to learn but to relieve the pressure of chasing every mark.  \nSome components may be designated as 'pass/ fail', which means that these do not attract a numerical mark but, instead, are given a binary pass/ fail grade. Such components do not contribute to the module's overall mark but, where used, are usually required to pass the module.  \nChapter 4, Section 3.7: Marking Scale | UCL Academic Manual  \nFeedback  \nFeedback and provisional marks  \nRegular feedback is an essential part of every student\u2019s learning. Students should expect to receive feedback throughout their studies in relation to their performance in both formative and summative assessments, including in relation to their draft final project/ dissertation.  \nUCL feedback policy",
      "UCL feedback policy  \nIt is UCL policy that all students receive feedback on summative assessments within one calendar month of the submission deadline. This feedback may take the form of indicative or provisional marks, written feedback, individual discussions, group discussions, marker\u2019s answers, model answers or other solutions, although students should note that UCL is generally unable to return examination scripts.  \nIf, for whatever reason, a department/ division cannot ensure that the one calendar month deadline is met then they will tell students when the feedback will be provided, it is expected that the extra time needed should not exceed one week. Where feedback is not provided within the timescale, students should bring the matter to the attention of the module's responsible Programme Director.  \nComputer Science feedback policy  \nFor taught modules, the department aims to release feedback for summative assessments within 20 working days of the date of the assessment/ submission deadline (i.e., excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays). Feedback for some assessments may be withheld until any approved extensions have completed, i.e., to ensure no unfair advantage to students submitting later.  \nFor research project/ dissertation modules, the department aims to provide feedback on a draft version within 10 working days, provided the draft is received at least 15 working days prior to the final submission deadline.",
      "UCL Research Ethics | UCL  \nMarking, second-marking, and moderation  \nInformation about marking, second-Marking and moderation, and the release of provisional marks.  \nAll work that is submitted for summative assessment is marked by a UCL Internal Examiner or Assistant Internal Examiner. All UCL programmes also include second-marking and internal moderation processes to ensure that marking is consistent and fair. Second-marking can take a number of different forms depending on the type of assessment, but the overall aim is to ensure that marking is as accurate as possible. Internal moderation also helps UCL to ensure that marking is equitable across different modules, pathways, options and electives.  \nComputer Science marking policies  \nFor Computer Science modules, one summative component of assessment will be subjected to an appropriate form of second marking.  \nIf a module is assessed by an examination, the scripts will be subjected to full seen check-marking. If the module is assessed by coursework-only, an appropriate component will be subjected to sampled seen check-marking or double-marking (usually the highest weighted component.) For project/ dissertation modules, the project report will be subjected to full blind double-marking, which will be anonymous where possible. In the event that first and second markers cannot agree, a third marker will be appointed.  \nExternal examining  \nInformation about external examining at UCL."

    "reference": "UCL's policy for Computer Science assessments permits the release of provisional marks for coursework prior to confirmation by the Board of Examiners, usually alongside feedback or sometimes following it. However, provisional marks are not released for examinations because exams occur close to the publication of confirmed results. Feedback on summative assessments is expected within one calendar month of the submission deadline, with the Computer Science department aiming to release feedback within 20 working days of the assessment deadline, excluding weekends, closure periods, and UK Bank Holidays. If delays occur, students should be notified in advance via the module's Moodle forum. The Main assessment period for Computer Science modules includes coursework submissions during the terms in which the modules are delivered (Term 1 from Week 06 to Week 20, Term 2 from Week 21 to Week 32) and examinations typically held between 29 April and 30 May 2025. This structured timeline and feedback policy ensure students receive timely and clear information about their provisional marks and feedback during the Main assessment period."

These questionnaires ask about a students' learning experience, the resources and materials they have been provided with, the teaching they have received, and their views on what could be improved. More information on student feedback surveys is given in [Section 18 Student feedback and You Shape UCL | CS Student Handbook](  \nStudent forum"

    "reference": "The Teaching and Learning Team run virtual drop-in sessions for student queries via Teams, which do not require an appointment but may involve waiting if another student is already in the session. These sessions are encouraged as they often resolve queries more quickly than email. Although the drop-in sessions mentioned specifically cater to MEng Robotics & Artificial Intelligence students on Wednesdays and Thursdays, MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering students can access support through their designated office hours. Specifically, Sobhan Yassipour, who is responsible for the MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering programme, holds hybrid office hours on Thursdays from 12:00 to 13:00 at room 1.08, GS, with appointments arranged via email. This combination of drop-in sessions and dedicated office hours provides multiple avenues for students in this programme to seek timely academic support."

In parallel, UCL places great importance on student feedback as a key mechanism to shape education and improve the student experience. Feedback is gathered through various channels such as student representative schemes, module dialogue via Moodle forums, departmental platforms, office hours, and online surveys including the National Student Survey and New to UCL survey. This feedback is taken seriously, with every response read and results shared with senior staff, including the President & Provost.
