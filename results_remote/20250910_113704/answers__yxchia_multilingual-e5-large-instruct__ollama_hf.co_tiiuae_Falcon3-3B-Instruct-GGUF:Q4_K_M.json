    "response": "According to the Board of Examiners' handbook, during your first year of the program, you will be required to undertake reassessment for any modules that you have failed at the first attempt and are not eligible for condonation. This process involves re-examining the failed modules to potentially pass them or meet condonation criteria.\n\nSteps:\n1. Contact your programme administrator for advice on accessing reassessment support as outlined in the Student Support Framework.\n2. Review the reassessment guidelines provided by your department, which may include specific deadlines and requirements.\n3. Ensure you understand the differences between reassessment and condonation to avoid unnecessary repetition of modules.\n4.
