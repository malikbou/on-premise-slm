UCL takes Academic Integrity very seriously and expects students to familiarise themselves with, and adhere to, UCL\u2019s referencing and citation requirements. A good starting point is the UCL Library Guide to References, Citations and Avoiding Plagiarism. Students should also ensure that they are familiar with the specific referencing requirements of their discipline, as these may vary.",
      "23.1 Summary of options for confirmation of student status and award\n\nStudents and graduates may request evidence of their student status and academic record from UCL, including official statements, transcripts of results, and academic references. The certificates and results pages set out detailed guidance on the types of documentation available, how to request these, and any restrictions that apply. The table below is intended to summarise that information; best efforts have been made to ensure it is correct."

    "reference": "An academic reference at UCL is a statement by a member of academic staff regarding a student's academic record, suitability for a post or programme, and/or their potential for the future. References are usually requested from Personal Tutors, Project Supervisors, or Programme Directors. To request a reference, students should contact the referee well in advance and provide relevant information about the purpose of the reference, such as details about the job or internship role, or the degree programme, along with any deadlines. References are generally only possible once results have been confirmed by the responsible Board of Examiners, and requests may take several weeks to be processed, especially during busy periods."
