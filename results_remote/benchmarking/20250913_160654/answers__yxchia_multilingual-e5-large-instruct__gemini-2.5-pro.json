    "reference": "Module information includes details about compulsory, optional, and elective modules within a degree programme. Compulsory modules are essential to the programme's core curriculum and must be taken. Optional modules are closely related to the core discipline and allow students to specialise in specialist or complementary subject areas. Elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline and provide an opportunity to explore interests more widely. Some programmes or years of study may not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where optional or elective choices exist, they are organised into groups with rules defining how many credits must or may be taken, whether selections must be combined or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests."

      "Each module/ module delivery has a fixed upper limit on the number of places available (known as the 'module cap'), based on the department's teaching capacity and other resource constraints.  \nStudents are guaranteed a place on any modules that are compulsory on their programme/ year of study. However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group. If a student selects an optional or elective module that has no capacity remaining, is not formally available to them, or for which they do not satisfy any prerequisites, then their selection will be rejected, and they will be asked to select an alternative module.  \nAll module selections are ultimately subject to approval by the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nOverlapping content & re-registering on the same module  \nStudents must not select as optional or elective any module they have already taken, either in their current programme or during any prior studies. For example, if a module is available as an option in multiple terms or years of a programme, it can only be taken and passed once.",
