    "response": "To understand your module options, familiarize yourself with the following:\n\n1. **Compulsory Modules**: These are essential for your core curriculum and must be taken. They form the backbone of your programme.\n   \n2. **Optional Modules**: Often related to your core discipline, these allow you to specialize in specific areas. You can choose them based on interest or career goals.\n\n3. **Elective Modules**: These are less directly linked to your core discipline but offer a broader exploration of interests. They provide flexibility and can enhance your learning experience.\n\n4. **Syllabuses**: Review syllabuses for each module to understand content, learning outcomes, and assessment methods. This helps in making informed choices.\n\n5. **Timetabling**: Be aware of how sessions for optional/elective modules might clash with compulsory ones or with each other. Ensure your timetable is balanced and manageable.\n\n6. **Consultation**: Discuss module options with your Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator for advice on combinations, load balancing, and future specialism suitability.\n\n7. **Module Introduction Videos**: Some Computer Science modules have videos to guide selection. Utilize these resources.\n\n8. **Contact Module Leaders**: For specific concerns about a module's syllabus, learning outcomes, or prerequisites, reach out to the Module Leader.\n\n9. **Programme Administrator**: If you encounter issues with your module selections, contact them for administrative support.\n\nSource: Programme Timetable and Academic Advice",

      "Module information & selection  \nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.  \nModules  \nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students",
      "Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.  \nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual  \nSection 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual  \nModule information  \nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.  \nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.  \nModule catalogue  \nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections.

      "Academic advice on specific modules  \nFor advice about a specific module, for example relating to its syllabus, learning outcomes, prerequisite conditions, or self-assessment of suitability, students should contact the Module Leader or general contact, whose contact details are set out in the UCL Module Catalogue.  \nAdministrative advice and troubleshooting  \nIf a student experiences any issues with making or confirming their module selections, they should contact their Programme Administrator.",
      "Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.  \nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.  \nKey contacts for module selection  \nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.  \nAcademic advice on module selection  \nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.  \nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.  \nAcademic advice on specific modules"
