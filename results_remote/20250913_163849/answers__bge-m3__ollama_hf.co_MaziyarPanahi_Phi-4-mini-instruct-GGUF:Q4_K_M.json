    "response": "Module Information Required:\n\n- Understand the distinction between core (compulsory), related electives/specializations within your discipline's diet.\n- Review timetables carefully; avoid clashes with mandatory sessions or other selected courses.\n\nSteps to Take:\n\n1. Check Computer Science Student Intranet for specific rules and requirements of modules on offer in your programme, including credit volume limitations per term/elective group (e.g., \"Modules for Computer Science students\").\n2. Consult Programme Director/Academic Year Coordinator/advisors like Personal Tutor or Module Leader if considering cross-departmental module selections (\"Key contacts for approval\" section).\n3. Confirm any pre-requisites and entry tests required before selecting a particular elective/module.\n4. If previously passed, discuss with your Programme Director to avoid repeating compulsory modules in subsequent studies.\n\nCaveats:\n\n- Ensure you understand the implications of overlapping content from previous degrees (e.g., \"Students who have previously passed...\").\n- Be aware that not all electives may be available for Affiliate students due to assessment timing restrictions (\"Modules for Affiliate students\").\n\nSource: Module information & selection, Modules for Computer Science students.",

      "Module information & selection  \nAdvice on choosing options and electives, general information on choosing modules, and key contacts for module selection.  \nModules  \nModules are the individual units of study which lead to the award of credit (usually 15 or 30 credits for taught modules, 30 credits for undergraduate dissertations/ final projects, 60 credits for postgraduate taught dissertations, and 105 credits for postgraduate research dissertations.) Each degree programme has a programme diet that defines the set of modules that must be taken (referred to compulsory or core), and, in some cases, that may optionally be taken (referred to as optional or elective.)  \nCompulsory modules are essential to a programme's core curriculum; optional modules are usually closely related to the programme's core discipline and provide students with an opportunity to specialise in specialist/ complimentary subject areas; elective modules are usually less closely related to the core discipline, but allow students the opportunity to explore their interests more widely.  \nSome programmes or years of study do not include optional or elective modules, with all modules being compulsory. Where programmes do include optional or elective choices, these are usually organised into groups which have rules set to define how many credits must or may be taken, whether any selections must be taken in combination or are mutually exclusive, and whether modules have pre-requisite conditions or entry tests.  \nModule availability  \nModules for Computer Science students",
      "Programme timetables have been designed such that synchronous sessions for compulsory modules will not clash. Sessions for some optional and elective modules on a programme may clash (due to the number of modules we offer and the finite timetabling options available), and therefore not all combinations of modules will be possible. Students must not select optional or elective modules whose sessions clash with those of their compulsory modules or with each other.  \nStudents selecting optional or elective modules should carefully consider the timetable that eventuates from their module selections in terms of workload and clustering, i.e. the balance of credits across the two teaching terms and the pattern of synchronous events in each week.  \nKey contacts for module selection  \nContacts for approval of module selection and for any issues that arise.  \nAcademic advice on module selection  \nFor academic advice on module selection, for example relating to taking particular combinations of modules, load balancing, or suitability for future specialism, students should contact their Programme Director or Academic Year Coordinator in the first instance. Students may also discuss their selection decisions with their Personal Tutor.  \nStudents intending to select modules from other departments, must seek the permission of their Programme Director in the first instance, who will advise on whether this is allowed and whether they must also seek the permission of the relevant Module Leader in the module's home department.  \nAcademic advice on specific modules",
      "Module availability  \nModules for Computer Science students  \nThe programme diets for students on Computer Science programmes are set out on the Computer Science Student Intranet programme level pages. Students should pay attention to the specific rules and requirements for their programme, the modules available to them, and the volume of credit they must or may optionally take from any optional and elective groups.  \nModules for Ancillary students (non-Computer Science students)  \nAncillary students (i.e. those on a UCL programme at a department other than Computer Science) who wish to select Computer Science modules as optional, or elective, should refer to their own departments' programme pages for information on which modules are available to them. Ancillary students may only select Computer Science modules that are formally part of their programme's diet. If a module is compulsory for an Ancillary student, then they will be guaranteed a place, otherwise places will be allocated subject to remaining availability, the order of priority, the satisfaction of any requisite conditions, and final approval of the Module Leader and Programme Director.  \nModules for Affiliate students (Study Abroad, Erasmus, Exchange)  \nAffiliate students (e.g. those on a Study Abroad, Erasmus, or Exchange programme) will be advised of the process for selecting modules by their home department. Modules may need to be selected before enrolment, or after arrival at UCL. Not all modules will be available to Affiliate students, particularly if a module's assessments would take place outside of the student's period of registration. Students should check with the relevant department to ensure they understand any restrictions and conditions.  \nComputer Science | Study Abroad at UCL",
      "Students who have previously passed a module that is compulsory during a subsequent period of study (for example, if they took a module as an option on a BSc that is then compulsory on an MSc), then they must discuss this with their Programme Director in advance of module selection and agree a course of action.  \nSection 2: Module Selection | UCL Academic Manual  \nSection 2: Module Selection - Overlapping Content | UCL Academic Manual  \nModule information  \nInformation about module syllabuses (i.e. their content, learning outcomes, and assessments) and timetabling of synchronous activity.  \nA module's syllabus is a summary description of its academic content and how students' learning will be assessed. The syllabus may also include indicative learning outcomes, which describe what skills and knowledge students should be able to demonstrate on successful completion of the module. Students should review the syllabuses for their modules to help them make any optional and elective choices and to help contextualise their learning experience.  \nModule catalogue  \nStudents can access current module syllabuses via the UCL Module Catalogue, which is a comprehensive directory of all modules across the whole of UCL, published in a consistent, searchable and accessible format. The content of syllabuses will vary across departments, but the catalogue aims to give students enough detail to make an informed decision about their module selections. Some Computer Science modules have published module introduction videos to help inform module selection."

However, places cannot be guaranteed on modules that are optional and elective, as availability will depend on how many places are left once any compulsory places have been assigned (i.e. a module that is optional on their programme may be compulsory on another.) Therefore, places will usually be allocated in the following order of priority: - Students for whom the module is compulsory (guaranteed a place.) - Students for whom the module is optional. - Students for whom the module is elective.  \nWithin those tiers, places will by default be allocated first to Computer Science students and then to non-Computer Science students on a first-come-first-serve basis within each group.
